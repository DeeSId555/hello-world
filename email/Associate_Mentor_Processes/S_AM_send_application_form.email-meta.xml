Become an Associate Mentor on 
NCS with The Challenge! 


Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

You’re receiving this because you graduated from NCS with The Challenge. 

This summer, there’s a fantastic opportunity for some Graduates to experience NCS with The Challenge again, from a totally different point of view. 

The Challenge Society is looking for Graduates to come back and volunteer on the programme this summer. Associate Mentors work alongside staff to support NCS Participants during the NCS Real Challenge Design. 

You will need to be committed, passionate and willing to share your own positive experiences from NCS with The Challenge. 


What&apos;s in it for you? 

Get great experience of mentoring and supporting young people 
Develop a range of new skills to enhance your record of achievement / CV / UCAS application 
Experience NCS with The Challenge from another perspective: you’ll be volunteering as staff - not as a participant! 
Fast-track your Challenge with Distinction award

Are passionate about their experience on NCS with The Challenge and willing to share it 
Are serious about learning new skills, personally developing and making the most out of a volunteering opportunity 
Can commit to volunteering for four days during one of the NCS Real Challenge Design weeks (there are various dates and locations throughout the summer) 

Desirable Qualities: 
It would be great if you are: 

Confident working with new people and speaking in front of groups 
Have experience of working with other young people 
Are comfortable taking a lead with things like ice breakers and group games/activities 

Whatever your level of experience, we will support you to get the most out of this role. The most important thing is that you are committed to the role. 


What is the time commitment? 

Attend a three hour training session 
Attend all four days of the Real Challenge Design (you’ll be able to choose which dates you attend when you apply) 


Sounds great. What next? 

This is a link to the application form where you will answer some questions. Remember to answer as fully as you can, and give yourself the best chance of being successful. 


Good luck!
