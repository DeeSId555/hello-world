    <subject>Your {!Job_Application__c.Roles__c}  Application</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thanks for applying for the role of {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}. As you will be over 17 years old during NCS with The Challenge 2014, we&apos;ll need you to complete a check with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) before you carry out your role.

This is nothing to worry about right now; the DBS check is completely free of charge to you and we&apos;ll help you to complete it.

We&apos;ll be in touch to let you know what needs to happen next.</textOnly>
