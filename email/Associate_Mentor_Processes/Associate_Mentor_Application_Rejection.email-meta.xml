    <subject>Your {!Job_Application__c.Roles__c}  Application</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks once again for applying for the {!Job_Application__c.Roles__c}  role on NCS with The Challenge this summer.



This is a very important role on the programme, and potentially a fantastic opportunity. So, we need to make sure that everyone who takes it on is prepared and ready for the responsibility.



Unfortunately, your application does not contain enough information for us to invite you to training at this stage.



HOWEVER, if you really want to be considered for the {!Job_Application__c.Roles__c}  role this year, there is still time to go back and re-submit your application.



Remember:



- You don&apos;t need to have loads of experience; you do need to show you are committed to trying your best.

- Try to be really clear about why you want the role, and what you can offer



I hope you&apos;ll consider re-submitting your application. If you have any questions, get in touch with us at grads@the-challenge.org.





Best wishes,




The Challenge Society Team</textOnly>
