    <subject>Please give feedback for {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Job_placement__c.00NC0000005EiNO},

As the summer is now over, it is vital that you submit feedback for {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c} who completed their {!Job_placement__c.Role__c} role on {!Job_placement__c.Wave__c}.

Please include all information relevant to {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c}, including whether they should automatically be offered a higher role in 2013 (please specify which role), automatically be offered the same role in 2013. If the {!Job_placement__c.Role__c} should not be rehired again, due to their behaviour, please select &quot;Do not invite back for any role&quot;.

If you have already submitted feedback for this person, please do so again, as the fact that you have received this email means that the feedback did not arrive in Salesforce.

Please click on the link below and fill in the online form. http://www.clicktools.com/survey?iv=3a13799148220a7&amp;q1={!Job_Application__c.Id}

Thank you very much for your assistance,
