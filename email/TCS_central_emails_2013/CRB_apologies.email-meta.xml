    <subject>About your Associate Mentor Application</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for your recent application to be an Associate Mentor. We are currently processing it and if you haven&apos;t heard already, you will hear from us soon.



You may have received a request to complete a Care Check or CRB application. This was a mistake on our part - you do not need to complete this in order to be an Associate Mentor.  We’re really sorry for any confusion!



Don’t worry if you’ve started the Care Check already, as it won’t affect your application.



We’ll be in touch,



Best Wishes,

The Challenge Society</textOnly>
