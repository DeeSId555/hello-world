Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

It was lovely to meet you at your Real Challenge Action weekend. Thanks a lot for signing up to be involved in HeadStart – we are excited to have you on board.

Looking to make some money this Christmas? Can&apos;t find a job? Perhaps we can help...

If you volunteer 16 hours of your time before the 13th November we will invite you to an interview where you will have a chance of getting a paid part time role with a high street retailer.
Yes, that&apos;s right, we want to help you find a job!

We have some inspiring charities you can get involved with to complete your hours, including your chance to design your own project with The Challenge.
And, even better, to help you get started we’ll take off 4 hours of volunteering if you attend your fourth Real Challenge Action day. So you’re already a quarter of the way there!

HeadStart is a great opportunity to develop key skills, boost your CV and get professional interview experience.
