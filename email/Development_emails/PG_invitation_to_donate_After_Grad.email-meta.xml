    <subject>The Challenge: Continued Personal Growth</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

Well done to {!Contact.FirstName} on completing the first part of The Challenge! As part of the programme, {!Contact.FirstName} was one of thousands of young people across England who took the first steps towards strengthening their local areas and developing new personal skills. But we don&apos;t want this to just be a summer project; we want to support this commitment to personal and community development year-round.

Last October we launched The Challenge Society, an on-going programme which engages graduates and their friends in youth-led projects after the summer ends. We are helping young people improve their future prospects through social action projects, youth boards, work experience, and seminars (such as recent CV workshops with Goldman Sachs).

To continue The Challenge Society this autumn we are trying to raise £100,000 from parents and guardians - which is only £10 per family. If you are able to support us, please donate online by clicking here: https://mydonate.bt.com/events/parents

In addition, we are working with businesses, individual donors and foundations (let us know if you have friends or colleagues who might be interested). This money will cover planning, executing and staffing the year-round projects.

As one of our graduates recently said:
&quot;Doing The Challenge encouraged me to develop skills I didn&apos;t think I had and build genuine friendships with people I would naturally ignore.&quot;

Thank you in advance for your support.

Yours sincerely,

Craig Morley
Chief Executive

P.S. We will follow up after graduation to get your feedback on the programme – but in the meantime, even though times are tight, any donation you can provide will help towards our goal of continuing The Challenge Society this autumn.
