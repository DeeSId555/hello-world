    <subject>The Challenge Society: Change starts here!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

Well done to {!Contact.FirstName} on completing The Challenge! It really is a testament to your childâ€™s character and commitment that they, along with others across the country, have now completed the programme.

We hope you agree that {!Contact.FirstName} has gained new skills, grown in confidence, made a difference in their local area and developed a network of friends that they are unlikely to forget.

However the autumn programme is only the beginning.  As a charity, we passionately believe in investing more in young people.


That is why we launched The Challenge Society (TCS). This year round programme will provide many benefits tailored to your child, ranging from personal mentoring, free CV workshops, volunteer placements and exceptional Challenge reunions to name but a few! I urge you to watch this TCS video to discover more about what this new programme has to offer.

As you may know, to continue The Challenge Society this year, we are trying to raise funds to continue our work with all our young people. If you are able to support, please donate online by clicking here.

I would personally like to thank the parents who have already donated. Each contribution gets us one step closer to our goal of ensuring that the good work started over the autumn continues through The Challenge Society.

I hope you will consider donating to us. Thank you in advance for your support.

Yours sincerely,

Craig Morley
Chief Executive
