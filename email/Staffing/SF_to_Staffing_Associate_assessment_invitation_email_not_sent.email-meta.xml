    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.OwnerFirstName},

The assessment invitation email that you just tried to send to {!Job_Application__c.Contact_Name__c} did not go through, as either the Cluster or the Role is missing on their Job Application.
Please click on this click to view and update the Job Application: {!Job_Application__c.Link}
Once you have done this, you can resend the assessment invitation email.

Thanks,
Central Operations

This is a standard email, sent automatically when someone tries to send a assessment invitation email without the required information.</textOnly>
