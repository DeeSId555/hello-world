    <textOnly>Hi {!HR_Event__c.OwnerFirstName},

The assessment confirmation email that you just tried to send to {!HR_Event_Attendance__c.Applicant_Name__c} did not go through.
There are two possible reasons for this:

1) There is information missing on the HR Event
2) You have tried to send an assessment confirmation for a training event.

Please click on this link to check the related HR Event: {!HR_Event__c.Link}
If the HR Event type is &quot;Training Event&quot;, you should tick the &quot;Send training confirmation email&quot; checkbox.

Once you have verified the information, you can resend the confirmation email.

Thanks,

Central Operations
