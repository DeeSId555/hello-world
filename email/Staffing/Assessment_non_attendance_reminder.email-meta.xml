    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName} 

Thank you for your interest in The Challenge. You informed us that you would like to attend an assessment and information evening with us, but were unfortunately unable to attend. I wonder if you could possibly click on the link and select a date and venue which might be more convenient for you http://www.clicktools.com/survey?iv=3a1315ddab8c0a8&amp;q1={!Lead.Id}
