    <subject>URGENT: Information on working with NCS The Challenge</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

I hope you are all well.

Apologies for the delay in replying for some time, things have become manic this summer with the numbers of young people&apos;s needs and the capacity to receive all of their needed information.

So I just thought I&apos;d send you an email to update you with where we are at in terms of matching support workers to young people for this summer.

We have matched the majority of young people for waves. But we are very aware that some of you haven&apos;t been matched, and we are trying our hardest to place everyone. Unfortunately a lot of this is out of our control, due to a lot of factors (e.g. less young people signing up for the programme in certain areas, capacity of gaining information needed).

If you haven&apos;t been contacted about a match this will most likely be because we haven&apos;t had a match for your skill set in your region for the dates you are available.

However I anticipate a large influx of young people this next week or two for a mixture of waves, skills and locations and are keen to match as many of you as possible. However this is impossible for us to know until we get the details through of the young people.

Therefore can we please ask you to hold tight, and we will be in touch in the next couple of weeks if a young person who matches your availability, skill and location is passed over to us.

I know this isn&apos;t the ideal and I am working really hard to have confirmations from other departments to enable me to offer more roles. And I am confident that there are a significant number remaining, but I haven&apos;t been given the confirmation to proceed. As soon as I have this I will be in contact.

We really appreciate your patience and your enthusiasm to work with NCS The Challenge. We also appreciate your understanding of the scale and complexity of this task which can make communication with everyone a difficult feat!</textOnly>
