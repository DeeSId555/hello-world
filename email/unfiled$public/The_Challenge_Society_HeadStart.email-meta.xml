Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Looking to make some money? Can&apos;t find a job? Perhaps we can help...

If you volunteer 12 hours before the 27th August we will invite you to an interview where you will get a 1 in 10 chance of getting a paid part time role. Yes, that&apos;s right, we want to help some of you find a job!

What’s on offer? The role available will be a 3 week part time job starting on the 9th September with Here_To - a great organisation that helps people to find volunteering opportunities in Islington.  They are looking for someone to help out in their office, support their partners and develop the website.
This is a great opportunity to develop your key skills, boost your CV and get paid!

All you need to do is sign up with a friend today and start volunteering - it&apos;s so easy!
