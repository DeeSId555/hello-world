Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Did you enjoy the project day in September or the Big Challenge . . . .then this is for you!

What: The Willows Project Launch, Saturday 18th May

Where: Canalside Community Farm

Time: 9.30am - 4.30pm

Getting there: Meet at Leamington train station at 9.30 and we will get you to the farm.

The Willows Projectâ€™s aim is to connect socially isolated groups, using nature to bring people together. To launch the project we need your help to paint the project shed, make growing beds and plant crops.

There will be lots of different organisations there to help and celebrate the project including Chapter One, Way Ahead Project, Mencap, ESHwork, and Springfield Mind. Come along for a fun day of activities, get to meet and learn about organisations working in your community, and eat an organically grown meal with cake to follow.
