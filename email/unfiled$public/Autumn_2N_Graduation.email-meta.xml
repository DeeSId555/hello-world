INVITATION TO YOUR GRADUATION

Dear {!Contact.Name},

Congratulations on your commitment and contribution to The Challenge this autumn!

You are warmly invited to The Challenge Graduation Ceremony along with two guests. At the event you and your team will be awarded your graduation certificates and will become official graduates of The Challenge, as well as graduates of the National Citizen Service (NCS).

So now you have completed The Challenge, you might be wondering what’s next? The good news is, this is not the end… it’s only the beginning! An exciting part of Graduation is the launch of The Challenge Society – which will give you the chance to stay involved in so many new and exciting ways. If you want to keep this amazing experience going don’t miss &apos;The Festival&apos; which will be coming to a town near you in February. This will will be a fantastic opportunity for you to reunite, make new friends and have fun!

I wish you a great Christmas holiday and I am looking forward to seeing you at your Graduation.
