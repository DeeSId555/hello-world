Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

We are running a survey to find out what you&apos;re up to since graduating from the summer programme so we can celebrate and reward all the great stuff you are doing through certificates, exclusive events and more!

The survey only takes a couple of minutes and the first 50 to fill it in will be entered into a prize draw to win Â£20 in your choice of Nandos or i-Tunes vouchers!

Click here to take survey

Good luck!!!!
