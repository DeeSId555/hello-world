    <subject>Your thoughts on NCS with The Challenge...</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Challenge Grad, 

At The Challenge we&apos;re always keen to keep in touch with people who have taken part in our programmes and hear what you think. This is why we may be phoning you in the next couple of weeks to ask you about your experiences. We use what you tell us to make changes to our programmes, improving the experience of other young people who take part.
 
If you are called, the survey shouldn&apos;t take more than 10 minutes to complete and we&apos;d be really grateful if you could spare us the time: so grateful that we&apos;ll enter you into a prize draw with a chance to win a brand new iPad Air.
 
We&apos;ll be asking you about your experience going on National Citizen Services (NCS) with The Challenge. You may know this as &quot;NCS&quot; or just &quot;The Challenge&quot;. For the sake of simplicity, we&apos;ll be referring to it as &quot;The Challenge&quot; from now on.
 
This is your chance to help shape the future of NCS with The Challenge.

Thanks!

 If you would like a copy of the terms and conditions for the prize draw, please email surveys@the-challenge.org.

If you don&apos;t want us to contact you to ask what you think about out programmes, please email helen.hardcastle@qaresearch.co.uk with your name, the year you started The Challenge and your contact phone number.</textOnly>
