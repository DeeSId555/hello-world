Dear {!Contact.Name},
I am pleased that you have accepted a conditional position to act as a Support Worker this summer on NCS with the Challenge.

As part of the conditions we need to match you with a young person. In order to do this I need to send you anonymised, sensitive information about the them. As you are not yet contractually employed by The Challenge we will need you to sign a confidentiality agreement before we can send this information to you. You will not be able to be considered for a match with a young person without this agreement returned.

I would be grateful if you would print, read and return a scanned signed copy of the attached agreement no later than 7 days from the date noted above. A scanned copy with your signature fulfils the requirements. Please ensure the file is less than 5 MB otherwise we will not be able to use the file.

Please do not hesitate to call if there is anything you would like to clarify.
