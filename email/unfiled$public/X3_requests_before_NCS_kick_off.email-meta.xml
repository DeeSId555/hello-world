    <subject>3 requests before NCS kick off</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear All,


Thank you for joining us as we seek to transform thousands of young lives this summer through the NCS programme.  We are incredibly excited about what is to come and hope that you are too.  By way of introduction my name is Benny Goodman and I am the Director of Operations which means I am responsible for our NCS programme delivery.


With our first programmes kicking off on Monday I wanted to write a short note to ask you to do 3 very important things:


Firstly to say that safety is about culture.  Whether we are talking about safeguarding, or live assessments of activity-related risks, the best mitigation against these threats is for all of our teams to establish a culture that takes safety seriously.  My number one priority this year is to keep young people safe on NCS. Where you see something that is not right, or just feels that it may not be right, please take action – either stop it from happening or raise the issue immediately with the appropriate person.


Secondly to say that we need your help.  We MUST only ever refer to the programme as NCS.  Please never refer to it by the name of the organisation you are working for.  As a co-founder of this organisation I am very proud of what we have and continue to achieve, but the money we are entrusted with is to run a programme called NCS.  In the past it has been called otherwise, and so habits do need breaking, but it has never been more critical for you to change those habits.  We are seeking to have a greater impact in the future by delivering more NCS places under an imminent new contract.   It is therefore vital that:

i) Young people therefore only ever talk about their experience of “NCS” (not that they have had a good time with us as an organisation per se)

ii) When not using their names, they are only referred to as young people or participants (and not a derivation of our organisation’s name as previously).


Only you as staff can establish this terminology whilst on the programme – please help us to do this from the very start.


Thirdly, do have a great time and in doing so recognise your impact on the quality of the experience our participants will receive.  As those with whom they are interacting daily, you have more impact than anything that can be set up in advance.  You have been recruited because we are confident you will be fantastic – and our standards get higher each year – so please do give it all you can and you can be sure you will see changed lives as a result.


All the very best as you work with us this summer, and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks.


Benny Goodman
