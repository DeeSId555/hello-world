Photo&apos;s and Quotes Needed!




Dear NCS Graduate

For all involved, NCS is a memorable and life changing experience. We have had some fantastic success stories from all over the country and we love sharing your stories with future NCS participants, which is why we would love to hear from you.
Tell us your best moments or send us a picture you took - we will then choose our favourites, and the winners will each be sent a £25 Nandos Voucher.

Please send over any pictures, quotes or stories you have of your time on NCS to gracia.molaso@the-challenge.org. Please make sure they are a reasonable quality and include:

YOUR NAME
WHAT SCHOOL YOU GO/WENT TO
THAT YOU ARE HAPPY FOR US TO USE YOUR NAME AND CONTENT

We can put a few of our favourites on our Twitter and Facebook page as well!
People are likely to send in group photo&apos;s that you may feature in. Please let me know if you DO NOT want any pictures of you to be used, by replying &apos;NO&apos; to this email.
Thanks,

Gracia Molaso
