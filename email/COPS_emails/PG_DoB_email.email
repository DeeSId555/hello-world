Dear {!Contact.00NC0000004a6DQ} {!Contact.00NC0000004a6Da},

I am writing to you as we do not have {!Contact.FirstName}'s date of birth in our records and we require this in order to process the application. 

I would be very grateful if you could call me on 0207 921 4510 or email me at dominique.standring@the-challenge.org with this information, so that {!Contact.FirstName} does not miss out this summer. 

Many thanks,

Dominique
