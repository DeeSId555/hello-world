<![CDATA[Dear Graduates,<div><br></div><div>I hope you do not mind me getting in touch, but with the summer fast approaching the fundraising team would like your assistance in getting more young people onto the summer programme in the future!</div><div><br></div><div>Last summer The Challenge Network offered you a bursary to come on the programme. We do not want anyone to be turned away from the because of their financial situation and thus we want to fundraise more money so that we can offer more bursaries to more young people.</div><div><br></div><div>There are some individuals and businesses who would like to pay for these bursaries which is really exciting. They would like to hear why a bursary helped you. Did you enjoy The Challenge? What new skills did you learn? Did The Challenge have a positive impact on your life? Without a bursary would you have been unable to go on the programme?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would so appreciate your response to these questions so that we can provide testimonials to those thinking of paying for a bursary.</div><div><br></div><div>Please note that any information you email me with will remain confidential. We will not use your name or provide them with any personal details other than your answers.</div><div><br></div><div>It would make such a difference to hear from you. Your stories are real. Do spend a moment to reply.</div><div><br></div><div>Much appreciated,</div><div><br></div><div>Ruth</div>]]></td>
