Dear {!Contact.Name},

We write further to our previous email regarding graduation. This email said that you were required to make up hours; however, this was not correct and was sent to you in error. 

We confirm that you do not have any hours to make up before graduation. Please accept our apologies for the confusion caused by this. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any queries.

We look forward to seeing you at graduation.

Best wishes,

The Challenge
