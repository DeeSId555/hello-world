Dear {!Contact.Name},

We hope you are looking forward to your graduation on Sunday at the time previously advised. 

Please be aware that, due to capacity at the venue, you will only be able to enter at your allocated time. If you do happen to arrive early, unfortunately you will not be able to wait inside the venue; however, there are plenty of coffee shops in the area. 

We look forward to seeing you at graduation.

Best wishes,

The Challenge
