Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We just wanted to send a short note to you all to thank you so much for all the work you have put into this summer on NCS with The Challenge.

Across many dimensions it has been our best summer to date, and not least because we have had the highest quality group of staff on board helping to deliver an incredible programme to 13,000 young people across the country.  There is no doubt that you have gone many extra miles to make sure that the experience of the young people in your care has been exceptional.  We receive so much positive feedback from young people, their parents, our partners and our core staff, and it all points towards the work you have done to turn the programme we have set up into something that changes lives.

You will have seen the impact that the programme has had on your wave or team, but please be encouraged to know that you have been a part of something much bigger.  Approximately 35,000 young people are expected to have taken part in NCS by the end of 2014, and we are proud to be the largest provider of a programme built on our template, first delivered in 2009.

Please do look out for further opportunities to work with us - whether on our autumn programme this year or in a role next summer.  We simply could not have the impact across many people and communities without the input from so many willing staff - thank you for joining us on our journey, bringing people together and strengthening communities.

In the meantime, if you are working as part of the NCS Real Challenge Action over the coming four weekends, then we very much hope that you enjoy supporting the young people through this pivotal final phase of our programme.

All the very best,

Benny Goodman (Director of Operations) and Craig Morley (chief executive)</textOnly>
