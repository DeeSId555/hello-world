    <subject>Amazing Opportunity to Volunteer at WE DAY UK</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Want to get a unique and invaluable experience at We Day! at Wembley and see acts including Dizzee Rascal, Ellie Goulding, Jennifer Hudson and Jamal Edwards?!

As a crowd pumper at We Day you are a leader and Free The Children ambassador who helps keep the crowd excited and engaged throughout the show.

We Day is an exciting event that relies heavily on the active participation of crowd pumpers. You will be responsible for delivering a short welcome speech to schools as they arrive at their seats. You will also guide them through audience interactions, dance sequences and other special moments throughout the day. You are the positive role model that will help set the tone and good vibes of an unforgettable We Day!

Check out what its all about here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJtlYhoUUTA

So What is involved?  We Day is on 7th March 2014.  In addition to being available on the day you will need to attend a training day as well.

Its really easy to sign up, simply click on this link to register:

See you there,
