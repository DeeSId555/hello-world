Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Here at The Challenge Society, we are loving all this sunshine. Summer is on its way. And you know what that means? The Challenge is soon to kick off again for three unforgettable weeks.  And we want YOU to come back and be a part of it!

The Challenge Society is inviting you to apply to be an Associate Mentor on our summer programme.

Associate Mentors are graduates of The Challenge who come back and volunteer with summer staff, using their knowledge and experience to support and mentor the Challengers. You will be volunteering on the Real Challenge Design week, supporting Challengers to develop their campaigning skills, pitch to the Dragons and to get ready for the Real Challenge Action weekends. This is an amazing opportunity for you to stay involved in The Challenge Society; to meet up with old friends, to continue to develop your teamwork and leadership skills and to really feel you are making a difference by supporting Challengers. You will be given training beforehand and be fully supported by Challenge staff while you are volunteering with us. This is also a great chance to gain valuable experience that will help if you want to apply for other summer roles with The Challenge in the future.

Sound good? Then what are you waiting for!

Click on the link below to fill out the application form. You will be asked to specify which dates you are available as well as your preferred area to work.  If you have already volunteered with us as an Associate Mentor in the past, then don’t forget you can apply to be a Senior Associate Mentor – just tick the relevant box on the application.

Good luck!
