    <subject>12th Nov: The Challenge Society - first Birmingham reunion event</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}
 
 Congratulations on becoming part of The Challenge Society!!
 
 Our first event of the year will be happening near you, in Birmingham, on Saturday 12th November. Weâ€™re getting creative with professional graffiti artists, drama and circus skills challenges. Also, fancy making and starring in a film which will be shown all over the country?
 
 Put the 12th November in your diaries and look out for another email over the next few days where you can confirm your attendance at this exclusive event!
	
 See you soon
