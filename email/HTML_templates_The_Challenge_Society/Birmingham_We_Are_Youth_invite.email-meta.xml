    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

    On the 12th November as part of the We are Youth campaign we are holding an event in Birmingham for a limited number of lucky graduates. Are you up for a real challenge and getting your hands a bit dirty? A film maker will be at this event and other events across the country to create a piece that celebrates your achievements! 

The day will involve three exciting community-based challenges and you will get a chance to take part in all of them:

Join a talented graffiti artist to create a mural in Digbeth

Work with a local charity, The Stroke Association, to support their work. 

Completing the performance challenge  with either a drama practitioner or circus skills practitioner.

There will be a free dinner at the end of the day, but you will need to bring a packed lunch.


RSVP by clicking on the following link:
