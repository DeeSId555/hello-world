    On the 20th February as part of the The Challenge Society we are holding an incredible event at Harris Academy Falconwood for you lucky graduates. Are you up for learning some new skills, catch up with your friends from the summer and enjoy some local talent!!!

The day will involve three exciting zones and you will get a chance to take part in all of them:

Our first zone gives you opportunity to choose a session you would like to attend; get a taste of what it is like to be a director or get some basic singing tips or get the opportunity to talk to Mandem on the Wall about acting!!!

The second zone will be a fare like set up with various local charities including charities set up to get young people into work experience and jobs. 

The third zone is our awareness zone that will involve you guys having discussions about sexual, alcohol and drug awareness. 

The event will end with an open mic session where local talent will get a chance to perform!!!!
