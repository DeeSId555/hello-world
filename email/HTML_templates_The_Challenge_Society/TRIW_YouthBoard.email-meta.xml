    <subject>Your Youth Board Present &apos;TheBigPicture&apos; this Half Term</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

&quot;We may all have different points of view, but together we create The BIG Picture....&quot;
 
Designed by us, The Challenge Youth Board, The Big Picture is a youth and culture talent showcase in which a range of exciting performers, such as spoken word artists, dancers, Sikh swordsmen and musical performers will take to the stage to demonstrate their skills as well as an open mic session to showcase local talent.
There will also be some ongoing workshops throughout the day with the wonderful Defcon workshops delivering spoken word and performance sessions alongside other partners.

Our idea is to bring the community and challenge graduates together to showcase young talent, bands and local performers in addition to working with and promoting local youth and art organisations. We will be raising money for some of our local charity partners at the event and anything that we raise that is not put towards the event will go to them.

Let’s admit it, exams are on the horizons and we’re beginning to panic, but surely we all deserve a break? The BIG Picture offers you a chance to relax and get together with our community regardless of background, and watch others or you yourself perform onstage.

When? Wednesday 16th April - 12:30 - 17:00
Where? The YAA Centre, 1 Chippenham Mews, London, W9 2AN 
(Near Paddington Academy)

So sign up here on Eventbrite, add your name to the guest list and come along!
