    <subject>Thank You for being an Associate Mentor!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName}
 
 Thank you so much for all the time and support you gave to The Challenge as an Associate Mentor this summer. Much of your advice, friendship and general fun were honestly invaluable, we have already had requests from this years Challengers to find out how they can be an Associate Mentor! 
 
 How did you find the experience? What would you do differently? How can we make it better for next year? What extra responsibility would you want as a Senior Associate Mentor? I&apos;d love to know your thoughts. Email them to grads@the-challenge.org. 
 
 If you enjoyed the experience and want to develop your mentoring skills, then we would love you to continue over the next year. You can either support a Youth Action team who are getting extra money to continue on with their Real Challenge projects. Or, this year we are also launching regional Youth Boards. These are local Challenge representatives (who were voted in during the Real Challenge Design week) in each area meeting together to give us advice and feedback from their Challenge friends and also plan a community action event. We would love to have you involved as a support for either of these teams. 
 
 The teams will meet twice a month from November until around April time and there is training during October half term. If you are interested, email me your name, what you learned whilst being an Associate Mentor, why you want to continue supporting a new team and which team you would prefer to help (Youth Action teams or Youth Boards). 
 
 All the best, 
 
 Helen (grads@the-challenge.org)
