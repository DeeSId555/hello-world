    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

    On 19th November as part of the We are Youth campaign we are holding an event in Preston for a limited number of lucky graduates. Are you up for a real challenge and getting your hands a bit dirty? 

The day will involve two exciting community-based challenges which incorporate art and photography and you will get a chance to take part in both of them, with the assistance of some of your mentors from this summer. 

Gill, the artist you&apos;ll be working with is an expert in the field of constructing community art projects. This project will be all about celebrating the environment and natural beauty.

This will be an opportunity to reunite with your Challenge mates, but don&apos;t forget to invite any non-Challenge friends who are interested in the event! A free hot lunch will be provided for everyone at 1pm.

You can RSVP by clicking on the following link:
