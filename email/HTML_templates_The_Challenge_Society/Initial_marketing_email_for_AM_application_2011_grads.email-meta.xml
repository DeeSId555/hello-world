The Challenge Society are inviting you to apply to be an Associate Mentor on our summer programme. Summer is on its way. And you know what that means? The Challenge is soon to kick off again for three unforgettable weeks.  And we want YOU to come back and be a part of it! Associate Mentors are Challengers who come back and volunteer with summer staff, using their knowledge and experience to support and mentor Challengers. You will be volunteering on the Real Challenge Design week, supporting Challengers to develop their campaigning skills, pitch to the Dragons and to get ready for the Real Challenge Action weekends. This is an amazing opportunity for you to stay involved in The Challenge Society; to meet up with old friends, to continue to develop your teamwork and leadership skills and to really feel you are making a difference by supporting Challengers. You will be given training beforehand and be fully supported by Challenge staff while you are volunteering with us. This is also a great chance to gain valuable experience that will help if you want to apply for other summer roles with The Challenge in the future.

Sound good? Then what are you waiting for!

Please click here for your personal application form! http://www.clicktools.com/survey?iv=3b1365e1600df14&amp;q1={!Contact.Id}. The deadline is midday on Wednesday 30th May.
