    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Labrinth, Maverick Sabre, The Noisettes, McFly, Stooshe, Diversity, Yolanda Brown, and Angel are performing at an event run by one of our partners and we have some discounted tickets available for people involved with The Challenge Society. The Spirit of London Awards are being held at the O2 Arena this year on Monday 10th December. This event is being billed as the youth community Oscars and we want you to come along. As well as the awards being presented by Olympians, this event will host some VIPs.

We are able to provide tickets for this event for just Â£15 pounds. We want you to come along and experience this event, get inspired and next year get yourselves nominated for an award. For a flavour of what this event will be like, check out a video of last year&apos;s event https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xldz7i3Hb6I and check out the Spirit of London Awards website http://www.spiritoflondonawards.com/sola-2012/.
