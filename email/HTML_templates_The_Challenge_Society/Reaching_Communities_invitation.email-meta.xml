    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Now you&apos;ve completed NCS with The Challenge, you can take part in The Challenge Society&apos;s social action programme Reaching Communities, happening in your area this autumn/winter! If you&apos;ve missed out on an Ignite ticket, this is another great way to stay involved with The Challenge!

An introductory evening is taking place on Thursday 6th November, from 6pm - 8pm at Pastures Youth Centre, 15 Davies Lane, Leytonstone, E11 3DR. To secure your FREE ticket to the event, click on the following link and register: http://goo.gl/U7X2XA

Want to stay in touch with your mates from NCS? Build your skills and expertise in running a project? Get Â£400 to make an impact in your community?

Then come along and find out all about Reaching Communities! There&apos;ll be free treats, fun, games and the chance to meet your new team and think about making a difference in your community. Call 07785 623339 for more info!

Best wishes,

Sam
