On 26th November as part of the We are Youth campaign we are holding an event in Croydon for a limited number of lucky graduates. Are you up for a real challenge and getting your hands a bit dirty?

The day will involve three exciting community-based challenges:
- A recycled arts challenge creating lanterns out of recycled materials
- Performance challenge with experienced drama or circus skills practitioner, and
- Practical action to renovate a local area called College Green.

You can take part in each of these activities, and there will be a free lunch provided at 1pm.

Please RSVP by clicking on the following link:
