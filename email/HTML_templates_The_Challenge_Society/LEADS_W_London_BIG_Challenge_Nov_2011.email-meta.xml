    <subject>Invitation to West London&apos;s first Challenge Society event</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}

The Challenge Society is launching its first West London event on 27th November, and you&apos;re invited! You&apos;ll be working with a local charity for social change and get to be part of a large scale flash mob in Walpole Park to feature in a film about The Challenge Society that is currently in production.

In addition to volunteering, this is a chance to meet up with your Challenge mates and some of the mentors from the summer. As if that isn&apos;t incentive enough, everyone who participates will get free hot chocolate and cake at the end of the day!

Think you&apos;re up for a real challenge?

Please RSVP by emailing grads@the-challenge.org. 
Places are limited so sign up now before it&apos;s too late! Only those who have RSVP&apos;d will be allowed in.

Where: 
Ealing Campus

The Green
Ealing
W5 5EW


When:
27/11/2011

11:00 - 16:00

Hope you can make it!

Best wishes,
The Challenge
