    <subject>Your Challenge with Distinction and some work experience</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName}
 
 How are you? I hope you have had a great end of summer. I wanted to check in with you about Challenge with Distinction, let you to be the first to know about some exciting news at The Challenge and a work experience opportunity. All in this new email design, what do you think? 
 
 Firstly if you have been volunteering at all over the last year please remind us how many hours you have completed by 15th October (email grads@the-challenge.org) to make sure we have the correct number of hours for you. Those who have completed over 42 hours will be invited to our graduation ceremonies to receive their Challenge with Distinction Award, if you believe that is you let us know. 
 
 At our graduations during half term this year we will also be re-launching The Challenge Society with a new range of opportunities for all our Challenge Graduates including the chance to continue as an associate mentor with a Challenge Youth Board who tell us what they think, a month of Challenge Action in November, regular big challenge days, a new improved website with a range of volunteering opportunities, events and personal development workshops. 
 
 The first opportunity is a different kind of work experience: A practical opportunity with Royal Parks (i.e. Hyde Park) including park maintenance and shadowing some of the supervisors. Anyone interested? 
 
 All the best, 
 
 Helen (grads@the-challenge.org)
