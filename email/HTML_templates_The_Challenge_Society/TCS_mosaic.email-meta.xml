    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

There&apos;s another free Challenge Society event going on this weekend that you&apos;re warmly invited to attend: help the Save the World Club to restore Kingston Town Centre&apos; iconic mosaic. Whether you love art and being creative, or just want to try something new and test out your skills, come along and give mosaic-making a go!

Date: January 14th (this Saturday) 
Time: 11am - 4pm
Venue: Save the World Club, Kingston Environment Centre, Fairfield East, Kingston KT1 2PT

Please RSVP through the facebook event, and bring along any friends who are interested on the day, even if they haven&apos;t done The Challenge! You&apos;ll need to bring a packed lunch.

Any questions?? Find Bruno at-The Challenge on facebook. 

Hope to see you there!
