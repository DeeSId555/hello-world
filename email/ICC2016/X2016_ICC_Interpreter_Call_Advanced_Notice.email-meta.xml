Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

We contacted you to get more information about {!Contact.FirstName}’s needs, however, we could not finish the phone call.

We will call you again in the next few days with an interpreter to translate our questions to you.

If you want to speak to us, please call 0333 150 2425 or email  inclusion.support@the-challenge.org  - we will be happy to help.

Yours sincerely,
