NCS: Consent Statement


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Following on from our earlier telephone conversaion I have attached our consent statement to this email.

This is to be signed by {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s legal guardian, agreeing to our terms and conditions giving permission for {!Contact.FirstName} to attend NCS.

After you have signed the consent statement please send a scan (or digital photo) to  inclusion.support@the-challenge.org

Alternatively you can send this by post addressed to Inclusion and Support Service, Elizabeth House, 39 York Road, London, SE1 7NQ.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us by calling 0333 150 2425 or emailing  inclusion.support@the-challenge.org  - we’ll be happy to help.

Yours sincerely,
