NCS: Medical and support information update
 
Dear {!IF(Contact.Parent_Name__c &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;&amp; ( Contact.Parent_Name__c ) &amp;&quot; &quot;,&quot;Parent or Guardian&quot;)}, 

Thank you for filling in the medical and support information for {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for National Citizen Service (NCS). 

You told us that {!Contact.FirstName} has anaemia. We will give this information to the staff who will be working with {!Contact.FirstName} during the programme. This is so they are aware of their condition. Please let {!Contact.FirstName} know that they must tell our staff if they are feeling unwell on the programme. 

Part one of NCS is very active and {!Contact.FirstName} may be doing high energy physical activities for example rock climbing, canoeing and hiking with an overnight camp. 

Please let us know if any high energy physical activities:
may need adjusting for {!Contact.FirstName} to participate
may have an impact on {!Contact.FirstName}’s condition
are not suitable.
Young people&apos;s health and safety is very important to us. If outdoor activity providers feel that it is unsafe for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in activities, they may be asked to sit out. 

If you’d like a full list of activities or more details, please get in touch with us using the contact details below.
