Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in National Citizen Service (NCS). 

We tried to call you to ask some further questions about the medical and support information you gave us. This is to make sure {!Contact.FirstName} is supported safely during the programme. 

Please note that places on NCS are provisional until we have all the information we need. If we are not able to discuss the medical and support information, we cannot progress with {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s application. 

We wouldn&apos;t want them to miss out, so please call us as soon as you can. We hope to hear from you soon.
