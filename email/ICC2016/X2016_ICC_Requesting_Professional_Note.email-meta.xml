NCS: Professional Feedback Form


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

As discussed during our telephone conversation today, I have attached to this email the feedback form to give to the medical professional working with {!Contact.FirstName} to complete. The information provided on this feedback form will be used to best support  {!Contact.FirstName} during NCS.

Once completed, please make a copy of the form to keep for your records and send the original back to us either by scan (or digital photo of each page) to  inclusion.support@the-challenge.org

Alternatively you can send this by post addressed to Inclusion and Support Service, Elizabeth House, 39 York Road, London, SE1 7NQ.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us by calling 0333 150 2425 or emailing  inclusion.support@the-challenge.org  - we’ll be happy to help.

Yours sincerely,
