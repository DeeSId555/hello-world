    <textOnly>Hi {!HR_Event__c.OwnerFirstName},

The HR Event &quot;{!HR_Event__c.Name}&quot; has nearly reached full capacity. It is currently at {!HR_Event__c.Attendee__c} attendees, which is 3 away from the maximum. This date will no longer appear on the assessment form when the maximum has been reached.
Click on the link to view the record {!HR_Event__c.Link}

This is a standard email, sent automatically whenever an HR Event only has 3 spaces left.</textOnly>
