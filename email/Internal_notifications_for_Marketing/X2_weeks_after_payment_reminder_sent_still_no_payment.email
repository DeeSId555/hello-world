Hi {!Contact.OwnerFirstName}

It has been a week since you last spoke to {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}'s PG regarding payment, but still we have not received full payment. 

Please get in touch with the PG again to discuss making this payment, and reiterate the various payment options available to them. Remind them that although we have {!Contact.FirstName}'s P2 form we cannot assign/reserve a place until we have full payment too.

Once you have made contact please fill in the field 'Date payment reminder call made'.

This is an automatic email sent when full payment has not been received following dispatch of a payment reminder letter and a phone call to the PG.
