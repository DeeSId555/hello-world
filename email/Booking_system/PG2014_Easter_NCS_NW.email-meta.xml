    <textOnly>The Challenge | It All Starts At Yes

Last few places for summer 2014!

Since January, we’ve been busy visiting schools all over the North West to let everyone know about NCS with The Challenge.

We’ve already had over 15,000 young people sign up nationwide, so don’t let your child miss out on the summer of a lifetime.

Sign up here between 14 and 21 April and pay only £35. Quote the code APRIL6 on the website.

It All Starts At Yes

We visited the lucky 15,000th sign up, Milli Bray from Glenburn Sports College in Skelmersdale, to present her with a sweet treat and say thanks – take a look here

Sign up!

We really do only have a few places left, so apply during the Easter break to avoid disappointment!

Financial support is available so get in touch if you need assistance in paying.
