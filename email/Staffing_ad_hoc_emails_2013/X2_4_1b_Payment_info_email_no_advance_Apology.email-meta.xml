Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

Please accept our apologies for the previous email sent to you, which did not state your gross salary. Please see below for the corrected version of this email.

Congratulations on being appointed as {!Job_placement__c.Role__c} with The Challenge Network this summer on {!Job_placement__c.Wave__c}.

Your total pay for this role will be {!Job_placement__c.Total_gross_pay__c}, which is subject to tax and national insurance deductions.
It will be paid on {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_payment_date__c}. Tax and NI deductions will happen from this payment.
