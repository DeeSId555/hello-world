    <textOnly>INVITATION TO ASSESSMENT
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations! We have been impressed by your application and would like to invite you to attend your Associate Mentor assessment.

How do I sign up to an assessment?

· Register for a free ticket on your local Graduate Team’s Eventbrite page with the password &apos;AM2016&apos;

· Wait for an email from your local team giving you all the information you need to attend

· No need to prepare anything – just arrive on time to the session you signed up to!



CLICK HERE TO REGISTER FOR A PLACE AT AN ASSESSMENT EVENT



You will need to use the password &apos;AM2016&apos; in order to register for your assessment.


You must complete an assessment to be an Associate Mentor. If you are unable to attend then please let us know – we’ll do our best to find another assessment for you to attend, but please be aware that this may not be possible.

What happens at the assessment event?

Assessment lasts about four hours (don&apos;t worry - there will be breaks!), and give you an opportunity to:


· Get to know other applicants and staff in your area

· Learn about the Associate Mentor role and receive training in volunteering on NCS

· Let us know when you are available to volunteer

· Ask questions about the role and get answers

Your DBS check:

Since you&apos;ll be 18 or over by the time you start your Associate Mentor placement, you need to have a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. DBS checks take up to 12 weeks to come through, so get yours started now! Click here for more information.

Need to get in touch with us?

Send an email to your local Graduate Team. Make sure that you include your name, and either the borough that you completed NCS in or your postcode.

Well done once again for making it through the initial application - we&apos;ll see you at your assessment!
All the best,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
