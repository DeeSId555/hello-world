Application Reference Number: {!Job_Application__c.Name}
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks very much for attending assessment.

The {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c} is an important part of our NCS staff team. We need to make sure that every member of the team is ready to take on the responsibility of their role, and that we are able to give each member the right level of support.

We feel that this might not be the right time for you to be {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c} . So, unfortunately we are not able to give you a role this time.

Please don&apos;t be discouraged from applying again next year - you are more than welcome to!

If you&apos;d like some feedback or more information, please feel free to email me, and your local Associate Mentor Rep will get back to you.

Thanks again for taking the time to apply.
With kind regards,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
Assistant Graduate Manager
