    <subject>Thank you for your interest in being an Associate Mentor!</subject>
    <textOnly>We have received your application.
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for applying to be an Associate Mentor on NCS with The Challenge.

Associate Mentor roles are only available to people who have graduated from NCS with The Challenge.

From our records, it looks like you are not a graduate of NCS with The Challenge, and so I am afraid we cannot proceed with your application.

If you are 15 to 17 years old and live in England or Northern Ireland, visit www.ncsyes.co.uk to take part in NCS.

If you are aged 18+ and wish to apply for a staff role, please visit www.ncsthechallenge.org/jobs
With kind regards,

NCS Graduates Team
