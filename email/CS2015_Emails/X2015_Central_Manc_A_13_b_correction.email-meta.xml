NCS: Sorry for our text message sent in error


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We would like to apologise for the incorrect text message sent to young people on Friday 13 November. This message included the wrong venue information for their NCS Part 3, social action day.

We are very sorry for the confusion and inconvenience caused by this miscommunication. An investigation is currently under way to find out how this happened and to prevent it from happening again.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the matter further please call us on 0203 542 2400 or send us an email to contact@the-challenge.org

Yours sincerely,

Jo Lunt
