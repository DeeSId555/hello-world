Instructions to get to meeting point
Monday 13 July


Dear {!Contact.Name} and Parent or Guardian,

We hope you are looking forward to starting NCS on  Monday 13 July. By now you should have received all the timetable information.

We wanted to let you know that  there are construction works around Dollis Valley which mean that access to the estate is restricted.

Please follow the instructions below to reach the Rainbow Community Centre (EN5 2UN):

Travelling by car

1) Travel along Mays Lane (the main road) until you get to Hera Avenue.
2) Turn into Hera Avenue and follow it 100 metres to the end.
3) Turn right at T-Junction along Dollis Valley way, follow the road around the perimeter of the estate, where it then becomes Dollis Valley Drive.
4) You should see a banner for the Arc Cafe on your right - that is the Rainbow Centre.

Travelling by foot

1) Travel along Mays Lane (the main road) until you get to Hera Avenue.
2) Turn into Hera Avenue and proceed to follow the road round to the left.
3) Continue to walk towards the construction gates.
4) You should see a pedestrian footpath running parallel to the green boarding.
5) Follow the footpath until the end of the road and then turn right onto Dollis Valley Drive, keep walking until the end of the road until you reach the Rainbow Community Centre.
6) The Rainbow Community Centre will be on your left.

If you are planning to walk to the location from High Barnet station it will add on approximately 20 mins - please bear this in mind.

Please leave plenty of time before setting off to the Rainbow Community Centre to get there for 10 am.

If you get lost on the day or have any questions before Monday, please contact Holly on 07880 038 089.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Yours sincerely,

Holly Dowling
