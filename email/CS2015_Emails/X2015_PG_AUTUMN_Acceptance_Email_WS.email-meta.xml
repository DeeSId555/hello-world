{!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s place on NCS is confirmed!




Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Congratulations – {!Contact.FirstName} now has a confirmed place on NCS, starting on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c}. {!Contact.FirstName} will receive their free NCS T-shirt either when we visit their school or college again or on the first day of NCS. We have sent {!Contact.FirstName} an email to let them know as well.

{!Wave_Selection__c.Girl_only_wave_prog_email_sentence__c}

The dates {!Contact.FirstName} will be on NCS are:

Part 1 - staying away from home: {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} until {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_Return_Day__c}

Part 2 - travel between home and a local venue each day: {!Wave_Selection__c.TC_KO_Day__c} until {!Wave_Selection__c.TC_End_Day__c}

Part 3 - travel between home and a local venue each day: 07/11/2015, 08/11/2015, 14/11/2015 and 21/11/2015

If you can’t attend one or more of these dates, please read the absence policy on our website to find out your next steps. Your parent or guardian will need to tell us about any absences in advance so please check this as soon as you can.

If you would like to change {!Contact.FirstName}’s programme dates, please log in to your online account to see other possible dates in your area. The sooner you do so, the greater {!Contact.FirstName}’s chance of changing dates. The website will let you change dates and will tell you if the dates you select are full. If you choose to move to dates which the website says are full, {!Contact.FirstName} will be added to a waiting list. This will mean giving up the place they already have.

If {!Contact.FirstName} can no longer take part in NCS, please contact us as soon as possible so another young person can benefit.
