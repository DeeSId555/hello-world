NCS – Hours to Make Up


Dear {!Contact.Name} and Parent/Guardian,

Now that NCS has finished, you are very close to becoming an NCS graduate!  However, as you missed some of the programme, you need to make up for this time by doing some volunteering so you can graduate. If you graduate from NCS, you’ll get a certificate signed by the Prime Minister and be invited to lots of exciting opportunities and events.

How many hours do I need to make up?
We encourage you to make up for all {!Attendance__c.Hours_for_100__c} hours you missed so that you really get the best out of the experience.  Chat to your parent or guardian to move one step closer to becoming an official graduate of NCS! {!Attendance__c.Hours_required_for_graduation_form__c} hours to be able to graduate from the programme.

What kind of volunteering can you do?
You and your parent or guardian will need to organise your own volunteering. For more information about how you can make up hours through volunteering, please go to this link: http://questions.ncsthechallenge.org/help/on-programme/absence/hours-to-make-up

When is the deadline?
The deadline for telling us about the hours you’ve made up in time for your graduation ceremony is midday on the Friday before your graduation ceremony. All ceremonies will take place in October and we&apos;ll send you details about your ceremony approximately one month before it. If you haven&apos;t made up your hours by graduation, you can still make them up by 1 December and get your certificate, which will be sent to you in the post.

How do I tell you when I’ve completed my volunteering?
You need to log in to The Challenge Society website at www.thechallengesociety.org using the unique login details on the TCS business card you were given during NCS. If you can’t find your login card, please use the ‘forgot your details’ option on this website. Then click on log hours and add your own volunteer task to enter your volunteering details. Please note that we cannot log hours over the phone.

What if I feel I can’t volunteer on my own?
We understand that for some people volunteering may be more difficult and you might need support to do this. If you think you might need support or might not be able to do volunteering for any reason, just speak to your parent or guardian and let us know by calling 0203 542 2400 or emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org . Together we’ll agree a plan.

More questions?
Call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org . Please do not reply directly to the email address we’ve sent this from as we cannot check replies to this mailbox.

So what are you waiting for?
Chat to your parent or guardian so that you can move one step closer to becoming an official graduate of NCS - with a certificate signed by the Prime Minister!

Yours sincerely,

Rachel Slade
Head of Programmes and Staffing
