What you need to know and do before you start NCS


Dear Parent or Guardian and {!Contact.Name},

This is your information pack for NCS (National Citizen Service). As we discussed, even though your place on the NCS programme is not yet confirmed, we wanted to send you this so you can prepare. Please read this pack carefully as there is a lot of important information here, including:

• Your NCS timetable –this shows your meeting points, programme dates, and where young people will be staying in Part 1, including their type of accommodation. You will need to organise to travel to and from the meeting points for the start and return times shown. Click here to see this.

• Your NCS information booklet – this has lots of essential information about NCS, including this autumn&apos;s packing list and how to contact us in an emergency. Click here to see this.



There are three important things you need to do before NCS starts:

1) Please check we have a correct emergency phone number for the parent or guardian and contact us if you need to change it.
We will use this number to contact parents or guardians in an emergency. It is your responsibility to make sure we have a correct number and that someone will be available to take calls on it. If you want to give us extra contact details, or if any of your contact details change, please contact us.

2) Please contact us if there have been any changes to the medical, support or dietary information you gave us about the young person, or if you need to give us any other details about this.
You are responsible for making sure we have full and up-to-date medical, support and dietary information, including details of any medication*. If you have any questions about this, please contact us.

3) Please read everything in this information pack carefully.

If you have any questions, please contact us.  You can call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org


More information about NCS

If a venue or time is shown on your timetable as ‘to be confirmed’, or if there is a venue change, we will send out new information as soon as we can. Please note that return times may depend on traffic so please make sure you have a way to keep in touch with each other about estimated return times.

If you can no longer attend NCS, please call or email us using the details above as soon as possible.

Please note that we cannot guarantee your place on NCS until you receive confirmation in writing. We have sent you this info pack because we think you have a good chance of getting a confirmed place. Please get in touch with us if you have any questions about this or if you want to discuss the status of your application.

Yours sincerely,



Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Service - The Challenge
