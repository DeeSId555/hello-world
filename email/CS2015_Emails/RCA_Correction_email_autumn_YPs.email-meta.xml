Email about NCS social action days
sent to you in error


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

You may have received an email earlier today about NCS social action days happening in September. Please ignore this email - it was meant for participants on our summer NCS programmes and was sent to you because of a system error.

We are really sorry for any confusion caused by this.

Pleas rest assured that we are aware you have signed up for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in our autumn NCS programme.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us by emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org or calling 0203 432 2400.

Once again, we are very sorry for any confusion caused by the previous email.

Yours sincerely,
Jo Lunt
Customer Services Manager
