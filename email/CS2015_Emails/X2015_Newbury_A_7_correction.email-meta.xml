NCS: Sorry for our text message sent in error


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We would like to apologise for the incorrect text message sent to you on Sunday 2 August. This message included the wrong start time for your NCS Part 2.

We are really sorry for any confusion caused by this incorrect message, and for the delay in sending out a correction message.

We tried to get in touch with all young people that had not arrived at the meeting point as soon as we could on Monday morning. We also called to apologise for the mix-up and ask young people to get to the meeting point as soon as possible. We would like to thank you all for making your way there so quickly.

Once again we are very sorry for the confusion caused by this miscommunication. An investigation is currently under way to find out how this happened and to prevent it from happening again.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the matter further please call us on 0203 542 2400 or send us an email to contact@the-challenge.org

Yours sincerely,

Jo Lunt
Customer Services Manager
