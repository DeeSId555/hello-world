Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in NCS.

We have tried to call you to discuss the medical and support information you submitted for them. Please call us on 0333 150 2425. Our phone lines are open from 9am - 7pm Monday to Friday, and from 10am – 6pm on weekends.

Please note that places are provisional until we have all the information we need.

If we are unable to discuss the medical and support information, we will not be able to progress with {!Contact.FirstName}’s application and they may miss out on securing a place on NCS.

Please call us as soon as you can. We hope to hear from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
