The new details for {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s meeting point are as follows:

Date: 05/09/2015
Time: 9:30am
Address: Trinity Sports Centre
Cambridge Street, Manchester, Greater Manchester, M15 6HP

Please click here: https://bookings.ncsthechallenge.org/assets/Central_Manc_B_10_SWM_SAT.pdf to see {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s updated timetable including details of how to get to their new meeting point.

We are extremely sorry to change your meeting point at such late notice. Due to a recent change in the availability of {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s original meeting point, we have been forced to move to a new venue. We are really sorry for any confusion or problems caused by this late change.

We will send young people an SMS on the day before each Social Action Day to remind them of the address, time and any other necessary information.  Please ensure {!Contact.FirstName} reads these SMS carefully for any further venue or programme updates.

If you have any other questions or would like to discuss this further, please call us on 0203 542 2400.

Yours sincerely,
Jo Lunt
