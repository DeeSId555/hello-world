Important changes to NCS passwords


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},


We have made changes to improve how passwords work on our NCS booking website.

Parents/Guardians and young people will now have separate passwords. Each parent or guardian will have an individual password to access their online NCS account, and so will each young person.

Plus, you will now be able to set up your own password for the booking website so that it will be easier to remember.

These changes will take place on Tuesday 24 February 2015.

We have emailed {!Contact.FirstName} separate instructions for setting up their young person password.

If you are a young person receiving this email, please pass this on to your parent or guardian and call us on 0203 542 2400.



Here are the instructions for you to set up your parent or guardian password:

1. Go to our booking website and click on &apos;Login&apos; - http://bookings.ncsthechallenge.org/
2. Click on the blue &apos;Forgotten password?&apos; link that appears below
3. Enter your email address and press &apos;Recover login&apos;

It is important that you enter your own email address, and not the young person&apos;s, as this process will set up the parent or guardian password.

Once you have completed these steps, you will receive an email asking you to log in and set up your parent or guardian password.


If you have any difficulty, or have any questions about this, please call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org


Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
