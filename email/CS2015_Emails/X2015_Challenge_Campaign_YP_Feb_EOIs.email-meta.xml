Say YES to NCS



Dear {!Contact.Name},

Recently you expressed an interest in doing NCS. You can take part in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity this February half term or, if this doesn’t fit with your plans, there are also several start dates over the summer to choose from. *

You may have seen our recent ad on TV and we’ve also produced a new film to remind you what NCS is all about….

There’s lots of information on our website and you can sign up for NCS here.

If you’re interested in what other people have said about NCS, you can find us on Facebook and Twitter.

Make sure you don&apos;t miss out on the experience of a lifetime.


Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
