{!Contact.FirstName} has been moved to the waiting list for NCS


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

We have moved {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list for NCS (National Citizen Service)

We sent you an email on {!NCS_Application__c.Date_CAL_created__c} asking you to pay your {!NCS_Application__c.Amount_due_outstanding__c} admin fee for {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS and explaining how to ask for financial assistance if you need help with the cost.

NCS is a very popular programme.  This means we can only reserve places without payment for a limited time before we offer the place to another young person.

As we didn’t receive a payment from you by the deadline, we have moved {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list.

What if {!Contact.FirstName} still wants to take part in NCS?

Please call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org. We will then try our best to find a suitable programme for {!Contact.FirstName}, or add them to more waiting lists to increase their chances of getting a place.


Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
