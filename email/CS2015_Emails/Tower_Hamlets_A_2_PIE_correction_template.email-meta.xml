Your NCS Parents’ Information Evening
CORRECTION


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

There has been a change in the start time of your NCS Parents’ Information Evening - it will now start at 7.15pm, rather than 6pm. Just the start time has changed - the date and address are exactly the same. We are really sorry for any confusion caused.

To confirm, the correct details for {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s Parents&apos; Information Evening are as follows:

Date: 16/06/2015
Time: 7.15pm
Address: Idea Store, 321 Whitechapel Road, London, E1 1BU

It will last for around one hour, with a short presentation starting within the first 15 minutes. It really helps us if you can arrive promptly so we can start on time. At this Parents’ Information Evening, you will have the chance to find out more about NCS, ask us questions, and meet other parents or guardians and young people who have signed up to the programme.

If you haven&apos;t already let us know you are coming, or if you now can&apos;t make it based on this change in time, please let us know by emailing anita.kessie@the-challenge.org or by calling  07880 038 088.

If you can’t make it but would still like to meet us, we will be holding other Parents’ Information Evenings for NCS programmes running in different areas, or on different dates. Please contact us for details of these alternative evenings.

We hope to see you at the Parents&apos; Information Evening.

Yours sincerely,

Anita Kessie
