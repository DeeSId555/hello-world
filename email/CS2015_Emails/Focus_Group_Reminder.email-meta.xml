Details of our Focus Group


Dear Vicky Bastock,

It was good to meet you on 28 July. Thank you again for signing up to come along to our parent/ guardian focus group.

The aim of this is to get feedback about our emails or letters so we can make any necessary improvements. It will be an informal discussion and all opinions will be welcomed.

As already mentioned, it will take place at the same place and time that the young people will meet at to start Part 2 of NCS:

Date: Monday 17 August
Time: 3pm
Address: The Hollyfield School,
Hollyfield and 6th Form Centre, Surbiton Hill Road, KT6 4TU.
It will last for around one hour.

As a thank you for participating, we’ll give you a £10 Love2shop gift voucher which can be used at many high street stores!

My colleague Chantelle Howard will be running the focus group. If there are any problems with you attending, please let me know by emailing lydia.reed@the-challenge.org or calling me on 0203 542 2393 (I work 9am – 5pm, Monday to Friday). If you have any questions at all, you can contact me using these details. I will also give you a call before the discussion group to confirm the details.

Thank you in advance for helping us to improve our emails and letters about NCS.

Yours sincerely,

Lydia Reed
