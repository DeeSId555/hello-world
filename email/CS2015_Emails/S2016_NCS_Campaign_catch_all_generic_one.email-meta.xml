NCS - don’t miss out



Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for letting us know you&apos;re interested in National Citizen Service (NCS). We are The Challenge and we&apos;ll be running NCS in your area this summer. Need a reminder of what NCS is about? Check out this video...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a591P6wYiGU

NCS is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It’s an opportunity to try new activities, make new friends and build the skills and confidence to help you in your future. Over 130,000 young people have already taken part - don&apos;t miss your chance! For more details, check out www.NCSTheChallenge.org

When is NCS running in 2016?
In 2016, The Challenge will be running NCS on lots of different dates throughout the summer holidays, so you should be able to find a programme that fits in with your plans. But, if you’re busy all summer, we also have a programme running during October half-term, with some weekend days after.

You&apos;ll need to be the right age to take part- you can check our age eligibility requirements at www.NCSTheChallenge.org/terms.

How do I get signed up?
You can kick-start your application by filling in some details online.Go to www.NCSTheChallenge.org, click ‘login’, and use your unique login details below to start your application:

NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}


The website will tell you that your parent or guardian will need to fill in the main part of your application. Please ask your parent or guardian to do this. If you’re not sure who can complete your application form, please get in touch with us and we’ll have a chat (our contact details are at the end of this email).

Alternatively, if your parent or guardian would like a paper application form instead, they can call us on 0203 542 2400 and we’ll send one to them in the post.

Is there a cost?
Government backing means NCS costs you no more than a £50 admin fee - even though each place is valued at over £1000. Plus, you get an extra £5 discount if your application is filled in online! We would never want the cost to stop you taking part, so your parent or guardian can also ask for financial support when applying.

Any questions?
If you have any questions, take a look at questions.ncsthechallenge.org or get in touch by emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org or calling 0203 542 2400. We’d be happy to hear from you.


Best wishes,

Tanya Dunne
