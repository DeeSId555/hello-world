Your NCS Parents’ Information Evening
CORRECTION


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

Please ignore the NCS Parents’ Information Evening invitation email we sent to you last week. Unfortunately we have had to change the date of this. We are really sorry for any confusion caused.

The correct details for {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s Parents&apos; Information Evening are as follows:

Date: 17/06/2015
Time: 6.30pm
Address: Queen Alexandra College, Court Oak Road, Birmingham, West Midlands, B17 9TG

It will last for around one hour, with a short presentation starting within the first 15 minutes. It really helps us if you can arrive promptly so we can start on time. At this Parents’ Information Evening, you will have the chance to find out more about NCS, ask us questions, and meet other parents or guardians and young people who have signed up to the programme.

Please let us know if you are coming by emailing omar.sharif@the-challenge.org or by calling  07557747547.

If you can’t make it but would still like to meet us, we will be holding other Parents’ Information Evenings for NCS programmes running in different areas, or on different dates. Please contact us for details of these alternative evenings.

We hope to see you at the Parents&apos; Information Evening.

Yours sincerely,

Omar Sharif
