Applications for NCS in autumn
are now open!



Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

As {!Contact.FirstName} is not able to take part in NCS (National Citizen Service) this summer, we wanted to let you know that applications for our autumn programme are now open.

The quickest and easiest way to sign up is online, where you will get a £5 discount. Parents or guardians should follow this link to complete an application and select a programme starting in October. You can use the login details you already have, or recover them here.

The NCS autumn programme is an exciting, part-residential 7 day programme for 16 and 17 year olds* during October half term - followed by 4 social action weekend days. The programme has 3 parts that will give young people the chance to Get Active, Get involved and Make Their Mark in their community. Through NCS, they will be able to gain valuable leadership, team-building and communication skills for the future.

We believe that all 16-17 year olds* deserve to take part in NCS. Each place is valued at over £1000 but government backing ensures that the full programme costs you no more than a £50 administration fee. This includes accommodation, food during the residential part, and all equipment for NCS activities. You can also ask for financial assistance when signing up if you need extra help with the cost.

We hope that {!Contact.FirstName} will be able to take up this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take part in NCS.

More questions? Take a look at our Questions page, or get in touch with us by emailing contact@the-challenge.org or calling 0203 542 2400.

Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
