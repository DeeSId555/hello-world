What you need to know and do before you start NCS


Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for agreeing to come to the first day of NCS (National Citizen Service) on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} in the hope that a place will become available.

Although you are still on the waiting list, each year some people can’t attend at short notice. In case this happens, we are looking forward to seeing you there with your bags packed and ready to leave! As discussed, if a place does not become available for you and you end up going home, we will give you a shopping voucher and you can have a refund.

This is your info pack for the NCS programme we hope you will get a place on. Please read it carefully as there is lots of important information here.

What&apos;s inside?

• Your NCS timetable –this shows the meeting points, programme dates, and where you will be staying in Part 1 and Part 2, including the types of accommodation. You will need to travel to and from the meeting points for the start and return times shown if you get a place. Click here to see this: https://c.na8.content.force.com/email/{!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}

• Your NCS information booklet – this has lots of essential information about NCS, including this summer’s packing lists. Click here to see this: https://c.na8.content.force.com/email/{!Wave__c.Programme_booklet__c}



What do I need to do?

Make sure we have all the information we need to take you away safely, especially full medical and support information and emergency contact details. We’ve sent your parent or guardian their own info pack which asks them to check this too. Please remind your parent or guardian to read their own info pack and do the things listed there. If your parent or guardian has not received this, please either email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org or call 0203 542 2400 so we can get this to them as soon as possible. It’s important.

If there is any information you think we need to know so that we can support you on NCS, or if there is anything you are worried about, please call or email us using the details above. You can also use these details to get in touch with us if you have any questions.


What else do I need to know?

{!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_Girls_Only_Wave__c}

If a venue or time is shown on your timetable as ‘to be confirmed’, or if there is a venue change, we will send out new information as soon as we can.

If you can’t turn up to NCS anymore, please call or email us using the details above as soon as possible so that we can offer this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to someone else.

Please don’t reply to this email address directly as it will not be responded to - please use the contact details above to get in touch with us.

We do hope you get a place on NCS. We will contact you if a place becomes available for you before the first day.

Yours sincerely,
