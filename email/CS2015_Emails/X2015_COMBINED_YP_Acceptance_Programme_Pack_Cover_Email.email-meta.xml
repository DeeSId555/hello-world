Your NCS Info Pack &amp; Next Steps -
Congratulations on Your Place!


Dear {!Contact.Name},

You now have a confirmed place on NCS (National Citizen Service), starting on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} – get excited! You will receive a free NCS T-shirt either when we visit your school or college again or on the first day of NCS. This is your info pack for NCS (National Citizen Service). Please read it carefully as there is lots of important information here.

What&apos;s inside?

• Your NCS timetable –this shows your meeting points, programme dates, and where you will be staying in Part 1 and Part 2, including your types of accommodation. You will need to travel to and from the meeting points for the start and return times shown. Click here to see this: https://c.na8.content.force.com/email/{!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}

• Your NCS information booklet – this has lots of essential information about NCS, including this summer’s packing lists. Click here to see this: https://c.na8.content.force.com/email/{!Wave__c.Programme_booklet__c}



What do I need to do?

Make sure we have all the information we need to take you away safely, especially full medical and support information and emergency contact details. We’ve sent your parent or guardian their own info pack which asks them to check this too. Please remind your parent or guardian to read their own info pack and do the things listed there. If your parent or guardian has not received this, please either email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org or call 0203 542 2400 so we can get this to them as soon as possible. It’s important.

If there is any information you think we need to know so that we can support you on NCS, or if there is anything you are worried about, please call or email us using the details above. You can also use these details to get in touch with us if you have any questions.


What else do I need to know?

{!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_Girls_Only_Wave__c}

If a venue or time is shown on your timetable as ‘to be confirmed’, or if there is a venue change, we will send out new information as soon as we can.

If you can’t attend one or more of these dates, please read the absence policy online at http://www.ncsthechallenge.org/terms to find out your next steps. Your parent or guardian will need to tell us about any absences so please chat to them about this as soon as you can.

And of course, if you need to ask to move to a different programme date, or you can’t attend NCS anymore, please ask your parent or guardian to get in touch so we can offer this once-in-a-lifetime place to someone else. We’ll try our best to find you another suitable programme date if you’d like one.

Please don’t reply to this email address directly as it will not be responded to - please use the contact details above to get in touch with us.

We are looking forward to welcoming you to NCS! In the meantime, you can check out our Facebook page at Facebook.com/NCSTheChallenge and follow us on Twitter @NCSTheChallenge .

Yours sincerely,
