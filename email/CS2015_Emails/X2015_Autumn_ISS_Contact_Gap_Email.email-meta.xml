An update on your NCS application



Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for submitting {!Contact.FirstName}’s application to take part in NCS (National Citizen Service) this autumn.

We wanted to let you know that we have received your application and are processing it.

We will call you as we get closer to the programme start date to gather further details about the medical and support information you gave us about {!Contact.FirstName}. This is so we can get an up-to-date understanding of any staff support or logistical adjustments {!Contact.FirstName} might need on the programme.

In the meantime, you can visit our Questions page at : http://questions.ncsthechallenge.org/ which contains lots of useful information about our programme. Or, if you would like to get in touch with us directly, please email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org or call 0203 542 2400.

Yours sincerely,
