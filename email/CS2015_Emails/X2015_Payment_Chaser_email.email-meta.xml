Next steps for your application


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!NCS_Application__c.YoungPerson__c},


Thank you for your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in NCS. We have temporarily saved them a place on the programme but you need to pay your {!Contact.Current_non_website_NCS_fee__c} admin fee by {!NCS_Application__c.Letter_email_date_reserved_place_lost__c} to keep {!Contact.FirstName}’s provisional place. If you pay online you will receive a £5 discount, so NCS will only cost you {!Contact.Current_website_NCS_fee__c}.

{!NCS_Application__c.Email_WL_DD_payment_due__c}

Places on NCS are in high demand so if we have not received the payment by {!NCS_Application__c.Letter_email_date_reserved_place_lost__c} we will have to move {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list and give the place to another young person.


To pay, please log on to our website here, call us on 0203 542 2400, or send a cheque made out to ‘The Challenge Network’, with the young person&apos;s name written clearly on the back, to:

The Challenge Network, Mezz Floor, Elizabeth House
39 York Road, London, SE1 7NQ
Once your payment is received, we will then be able to continue processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s application.

Here is a link to our booking website: https://bookings.ncsthechallenge.org/

We never want the cost to stop anyone taking part so, if you need help with this please log in to your online account, go to the payment section and select the option to ask for financial assistance. Or you can give us a call and we would be happy to advise you further.

Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
