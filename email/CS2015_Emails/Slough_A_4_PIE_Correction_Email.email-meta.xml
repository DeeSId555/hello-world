Your NCS Parents’ Information Evening
CORRECTION


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

The NCS Parents’ Information Evening invitation email we sent to you last week was missing some important contact details for you to confirm your attendance. We are really sorry for any confusion caused.

The details for {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s Parents&apos; Information Evening remain the same and are as follows:

Date: 29/06/2015
Time: 6:30pm
Address: East Berkshire College, Langley Campus, Station Rd, Slough SL3 8BY

It will last for around one hour, with a short presentation starting within the first 15 minutes. It really helps us if you can arrive promptly so we can start on time. At this Parents’ Information Evening, you will have the chance to find out more about NCS, ask us questions, and meet other parents or guardians and young people who have signed up to the programme.

Please let us know if you are coming by emailing maria.wooldridge@the-challenge.org or by calling 07867601383.

If you can’t make it but would still like to meet us, we will be holding other Parents’ Information Evenings for NCS programmes running in different areas, or on different dates. Please contact us for details of these alternative evenings.

We hope to see you at the Parents&apos; Information Evening.

Yours sincerely,

Maria Wooldridge
