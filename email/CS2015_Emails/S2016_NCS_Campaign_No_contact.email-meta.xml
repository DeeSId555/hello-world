Don&apos;t miss out on NCS



Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As you told us you&apos;re interested in NCS, we wanted to introduce ourselves.  We are The Challenge and we are running NCS in your area next summer. We have tried to contact you to tell you more about NCS but haven&apos;t managed to speak to you yet.

Here&apos;s a taster of what NCS is all about...
https://youtu.be/c3dJB-K8nBY

NCS is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet new people, make new friends and build the skills and confidence to help you get ahead. Over 120,000 young people have already taken part - don&apos;t miss your chance this autumn!

How long does it last?
Part 1 - Get Active: four days (three nights) staying away from home in the countryside doing outdoor adventure activities.
Part 2 - Get Involved: three activity days developing skills, staying at home at night.
Part 3 - Make Your Mark: community activity days, staying at home at night - weekend days on 7, 8, 14 and 21 November.

Is there a cost?
Even though each place is valued at over £1000, government backing means NCS costs you no more than a £50 admin fee.  Plus, you get an extra £5 discount when you sign up online.

How do I apply?
Go to www.NCSTheChallenge.org and use the following unique login details to apply:

NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

The website will tell you that some parts need to be completed by your parent or guardian. Please ask them to log in to complete these.

It is quicker to apply online but if your parent or guardian would like a paper copy of the application form instead, please call us on 0203 542 2400 and we’ll send one out in the post.

Any questions?
If you have any questions, take a look at questions.ncsthechallenge.org, or get in touch by calling 020 3542 2400 or emailing  contact@the-challenge.org.

Places are filling up fast for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity so make sure you don&apos;t miss out! We&apos;ll be in touch once we&apos;ve received your application.

Yours sincerely,

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
