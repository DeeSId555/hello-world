{!Contact.FirstName} is on the waiting list for NCS


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

{!Contact.FirstName} is on the waiting list for NCS (National Citizen Service)

Thank you for {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS. It is a popular programme so at the moment {!Contact.FirstName} is on the waiting list. However, they still have a good chance of getting a place.

How can I increase {!Contact.FirstName}’s chances of getting a place?

Simply log in to your online account at https://bookings.the-challenge.org to see if there are other programme dates that may be suitable for {!Contact.FirstName}. The website will let you add extra dates. Or, you can contact us directly to discuss this by calling 0203 542 2400. The more dates you add, the greater {!Contact.FirstName}’s chance of taking part in NCS. If you are happy for {!Contact.FirstName} to travel to a programme which is further away and may have places available, you can also contact us to discuss this.

When will I find out more?

We will call you if a place becomes available. Places can become available at any time, right up to the programme start date. If we are not able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place, you can of course get a full refund.

We hope to be able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place soon.

Yours sincerely,
