Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

The Challenge would like to invite you to take part in a focus group (a small discussion group), to help us make NCS a more accessible and successful programme that has a big impact on young people&apos;s future.

Who? We want to speak to young people just like you, who expressed an interest in NCS but then didn&apos;t go on to sign up.

Why? So that we can learn how best to work with young people in the future. By taking part, you will be able to use the session as a valuable extra-curricular activity for your CVs or university applications.

When? The focus group is scheduled for a maximum of one hour on Monday 25th May. The session will take place at The Challenge offices in Birmingham (52 Charlotte Street, B3 1AR) between 5pm and 6pm.

In return for your time, you will receive a £30 Nandos voucher.

Please let us know you plan to attend by registering on our event page, or reply to this email if you have any questions regarding the session.

Thanks for helping us to improve NCS.  If you have any questions, please email me on nick.oram@the-challenge.org.

Best wishes,

Nick Oram
