Your NCS summer 2015


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},


With only a few weeks left until NCS summer 2015 starts we’d like to let you that {!Contact.FirstName} is still on the waiting list for the dates originally chosen.

These programmes are very full, however later in the summer; from
20 July onwards there is more availability and the likelihood that {!Contact.FirstName} could opt to go with a friend if requested.

If the original dates are the only ones that will be possible for {!Contact.FirstName}, we will keep them on the waiting list and let you know as soon as a place becomes available.

Programme places may become available in other areas on your preferred dates - if this  is of interest and you are happy for {!Contact.FirstName} to travel a short distance, please contact us.

We don’t want {!Contact.FirstName} to miss out on the once in a lifetime opportunity of NCS so please:

•	Select additional dates online using your log in details* - https://bookings.ncsthechallenge.org/
•	Contact us by phone on 0203 542 2400

We hope that you are able to find a programme date that is convenient.

Best wishes

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
