SORRY WE MISSED YOU!

Dear {!Contact.Name},


As you&apos;ll be turning 18 soon we just wanted to say that we&apos;re sorry you weren&apos;t able to take part in NCS.

So far this year more than 20,000 young people have signed up to take part!

Here&apos;s what you&apos;ll be missing:

•The opportunity to gain skills and experience you can put on your CV

•The experience and freedom of life away from home

•The chance to take on new challenges and get out of your comfort zone

•Access to exclusive NCS events, opportunities &amp; more

•The chance to make a difference


UNLESS...

Unless you grasp this one last opportunity to take part.

What are you waiting for? SAY YES to NCS and begin your journey now.
