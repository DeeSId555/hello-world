SO, YOU DECIDED TO #SAYYES

Hi {!Contact.Name},

It&apos;s great you said YES to NCS and we&apos;re looking forward to meeting you this summer.

This really will be the chance of a lifetime and, it doesn&apos;t stop there! Once you&apos;ve completed NCS there&apos;s even more to look forward to; from unique opportunities and exclusive offers to special events like this one at Thorpe Park Resort where young people were invited to an exclusive VIP only, day of rides and meeting celebs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR6D251CVqQ

DON&apos;T FORGET...

YouTubers Ali-A and Emily-Victoria Carnham will be visiting the programme this summer and could be visiting your wave! In the meantime find out how they won their place on NCS  here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CJl09rX2gA&amp;feature=youtu.be
