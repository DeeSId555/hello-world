Your NCS application - next steps



Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for starting your NCS application. We are The Challenge and we&apos;ll be running NCS in your area next summer.

Completing your NCS application
You&apos;ve already made a start on your application, but you now need to complete it. Go to www.NCSTheChallenge.org and use the following unique login details to continue your application:

NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

The website will tell you that some parts need to be completed by your parent or guardian. Please ask them to log in to complete these.

It is quicker to apply online but if your parent or guardian would like a paper copy of the application form instead, please call us on 020 3542 2400 and we’ll send one out in the post.

Any questions?
If you have any questions, take a look at questions.ncsthechallenge.org, or get in touch by calling 020 3542 2400 or emailing  contact@the-challenge.org.

Places are filling up fast so make sure you don&apos;t miss out! We&apos;ll be in touch once we&apos;ve received your application.

Yours sincerely,

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
