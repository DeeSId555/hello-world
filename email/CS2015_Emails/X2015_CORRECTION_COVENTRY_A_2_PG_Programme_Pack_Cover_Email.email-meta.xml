What you need to know and do before NCS starts -
CORRECTION


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

There may have been an error with the Part 3 dates displaying on your timetable. If you opened your NCS information pack soon after we sent it, this may have incorrectly said that Part 3 will run from Monday to Thursday. However, the Part 3 days will run from Tuesday to Friday.

If you click on the link to your timetable again, it will now display the correct days. We are really sorry for any confusion caused. Please do call us on 0203 542 2400 if you have any questions.

You can find all the correct information in your NCS information pack below:


We hope {!Contact.FirstName} is looking forward to NCS (National Citizen Service). This is your information pack for {!Contact.FirstName}’s NCS programme. Please read it carefully as there is a lot of important information here, including:

• {!Contact.FirstName}’s NCS timetable - this shows {!Contact.FirstName}’s meeting points, programme dates, and where they will be staying in Part 1 and Part 2, including their types of accommodation. You will need to organise {!Contact.FirstName}’s transport to and from the meeting points for the start and return times shown. Click here to see this: https://bookings.ncsthechallenge.org/assets/Coventry_A_2_NCS3P.pdf

• Your NCS information booklet - this has lots of essential information about NCS, including this summer’s packing lists and how to contact us in an emergency. Click here to see this: http://www.ncsthechallenge.org/programme_info/programme_booklet_2015-NCS3P.html



There are three important things you need to do before {!Contact.FirstName} starts NCS:

1.Please check we have the correct emergency phone number for you and contact us if you need to change it.

The number we have is: {!Contact.Parent_Emergency_Phone__c}

We will use this number to contact parents or guardians in an emergency. It is your responsibility to make sure we have a correct number and that someone will be available to take calls on it. If you want to give us extra contact details, or if any of your contact details change, please contact us.

2. Please contact us if there have been any changes to the medical, support or dietary information you gave us about {!Contact.FirstName}, or if you need to give us any other details about this.
You are responsible for making sure we have full and up-to-date medical, support and dietary information, including details of any medication*. If you have any questions about this, please contact us.

3. Please read everything in this information pack carefully.
