Instructions to get to the
Rainbow Community Centre


Dear {!Contact.Name} and Parent or Guardian,

By now you should have received all the details for your NCS programme, including an invitation to the Parents’ Information Evening and your NCS timetable.

You will notice that we are meeting at the Rainbow Community Centre. We wanted to let you know that there are construction works going on close to the Rainbow Community Centre which mean it will take you longer to get there.

Access to Dollis Valley Drive is restricted. Please follow the instructions below to reach the Rainbow Community Centre, Dollis Valley Drive, EN5 2UN.

Travelling by car

1) Travel along Mays Lane (the main road) until you get to Hera Avenue.
2) Turn into Hera Avenue and follow it 100 metres to the end.
3) Turn right at T-Junction along Dollis Valley way, follow the road around the perimeter of the estate, where it then becomes Dollis Valley Drive.
4) You should see a banner for the Arc Cafe on your right - that is the Rainbow Centre.

Travelling by foot

1) Travel along Mays Lane (the main road) until you get to Hera Avenue.
2) Turn into Hera Avenue and proceed to follow the road round to the left.
3) Continue to walk towards the construction gates.
4) You should see a pedestrian footpath running parallel to the green boarding.
5) Follow the footpath until the end of the road and then turn right onto Dollis Valley Drive, keep walking until the end of the road until you reach the Rainbow Community Centre.
6) The Rainbow Community Centre will be on your left.

Please leave plenty of time before setting off to the Rainbow Community Centre, in case you have difficulty finding it.

If you are planning to walk to the location from High Barnet station it will add on approximately 20 minutes - please bear this in mind.

If you get lost, please contact us on 07880 038 089 (Holly), 07469 151 463 (Rachel) or 07857 031 857 (Georgia).

Please check your timetable and Parents’ Information Evening invitation for details of the dates and times.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Yours sincerely,

Holly, Rachel and Georgia
