Dear Parent/ Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in NCS. We have tried to contact you recently to discuss the medical and support information you submitted for them.

Please call us on 0203 542 2400. Our phone lines are open from 9am-7pm Monday to Friday, and from 10am – 4pm on Saturdays.

Please note that places are provisional until we have all the information we need. If we are unable to discuss the medical and support information you submitted, we will not be able to progress with {!Contact.FirstName}’s application and they may miss out on securing a place on NCS.

Places for our programme are in very high demand. To help us secure a place for {!Contact.FirstName}, please call us as soon as possible. As mentioned in the voicemail we left, we may have to move {!Contact.FirstName} to a waiting list unless we hear from you within a week of when we left you the voicemail.

Once we have received and reviewed all of the information, we will be able to progress with {!Contact.FirstName}’s application.

We hope to hear from you soon.

Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
