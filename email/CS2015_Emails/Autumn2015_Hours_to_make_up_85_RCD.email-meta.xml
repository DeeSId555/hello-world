NCS – Hours to Make Up


Dear {!Contact.Name} and Parent or Guardian,

You’re now well on your way to becoming an NCS graduate!  However, as you missed some of the programme, you should now be thinking about making up for the hours you missed by doing some volunteering. If you graduate from NCS, you’ll get a certificate signed by the Prime Minister and be invited to lots of exciting opportunities and events.

How many hours do I need to make up?
We encourage you to make up for all {!Attendance__c.Hours_for_100__c} hours you missed so that you really get the best out of the experience.  But, to be able to graduate from NCS, you only need to make up {!Attendance__c.Hours_required_for_graduation_form__c} hours. If you miss any more of NCS from now onwards, it is likely that you’ll need to make up more hours. If you miss too much of the programme, you may not be able to graduate at all so please keep that in mind!

What kind of volunteering can you do?
You and your parent or guardian will need to organise your own volunteering. For more information about how you can make up hours through volunteering, please click here.

When is the deadline?
The deadline for telling us about the hours you’ve made up in time for your graduation ceremony is midday on the day before your graduation ceremony. Your ceremony will be on {!Wave__c.Graduation_Date__c} - we&apos;ll send more details in the post (you may even have already received these!). If you haven&apos;t made up your hours by graduation, you can still make them up by the end of the year and get your certificate, which will be sent to you in the post.

How do I tell you when I’ve completed my volunteering?
You need to log in to The Challenge Society website at www.thechallengesociety.org using the unique login details on the TCS business card you were given during NCS. If you can’t find your login card, please use the ‘forgot your details’ option on this website. Then click on &apos;log hours&apos; and &apos;add your own volunteer task&apos; to enter your volunteering details. Please note that we cannot log hours over the phone.

What if I feel I can’t volunteer on my own?
We understand that for some people volunteering may be more difficult and you might need support to do this. If you think you might need support or might not be able to do volunteering for any reason, just speak to your parent or guardian and let us know by calling 0203 542 2400 or emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org . Together we’ll agree a plan.

More questions?
Call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org . Please do not reply directly to the email address we’ve sent this from as we cannot check replies to this mailbox.

So what are you waiting for?
Chat to your parent or guardian so that you can move one step closer to becoming an official graduate of NCS - with a certificate signed by the Prime Minister!

Yours sincerely,

Rachel Slade
Head of Programmes and Staffing
