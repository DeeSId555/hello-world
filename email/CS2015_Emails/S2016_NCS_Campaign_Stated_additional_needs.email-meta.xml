Joining NCS - your next steps


Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for letting us know you&apos;re interested in National Citizen Service (NCS). We are The Challenge, and we&apos;ll be running NCS in your area this summer. We understand you might need some additional support on NCS so we wanted to let you know your next steps.

How to tell us about any support you need:
- As part of your application, we need your parent or guardian to fill in a medical and support information section. This is the best place for them to put all the information about your needs. It will really help us to understand and cater for them on NCS.

- If you would like to contact us to talk about any support you need, please get in touch by calling 0333 150 2425 or emailing inclusion.support@the-challenge.org . 

We are an inclusive organisation and we ask for this information so we can understand what support you may need on NCS.

How to start your application:
Your parent or guardian will need to fill in most of your application but you can kick-start it by filling in some details, such as updating your contact details. Go to www.NCSTheChallenge.org, click ‘login’, and use your unique login details below to start your application:

Your NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Your young person password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

The website will guide you through your application and will let you know when your parent or guardian needs to fill in the rest. Please ask your parent or guardian to fill in these sections of your application. If you’re not sure who can complete your application form, please contact us and we’ll have a chat.

It is quicker to apply online but if your parent or guardian would like a paper application form instead, they can call us on 0203 542 2400 and we’ll send one to them in the post.

Even though you expressed a preference to take part at a certain time, all our dates are subject to availability - so please ask your parent or guardian to complete your application and select your dates as soon as possible.

What happens after I’ve applied?
After we receive your application, we will use any information about your additional needs to understand what support you may need during NCS.  We may also be in touch with your parent or guardian if we need any more details. Please note this will not affect your place on NCS.

Any questions?
If you have any questions, you can search for answers to frequently asked questions online at http://questions.ncsthechallenge.org/ or get in touch with us by emailing inclusion.support@the-challenge.org or calling 0333 150 2425. We’d be happy to hear from you.

Best wishes,

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services
