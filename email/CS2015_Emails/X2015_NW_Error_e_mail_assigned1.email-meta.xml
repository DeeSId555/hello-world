{!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s meeting points for NCS




Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for your application for {!Contact.Name} to take part in NCS. We hope they are looking forward to spending some of their summer with us.

They currently have a confirmed* place starting on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} for the programme with meeting points in {!Wave__c.Boroughs_or_areas__c} borough. However, we have noticed that this is outside of their school’s borough.

If {!Contact.Name} is unable to travel to this location and you would like to change to a different one, please call us as soon as possible on 0203 542 2400. We will then try our best to place them on a more suitable programme.

Yours sincerely,
