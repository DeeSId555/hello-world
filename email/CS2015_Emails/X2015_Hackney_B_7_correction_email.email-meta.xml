Change in Part 2 Accommodation


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

{!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s residential accommodation for NCS Part 2 has changed from the details on the timetable sent to you previously.

{!Contact.FirstName} will now be staying at Ewen Henderson Court.

The meeting point has not changed, so {!Contact.FirstName} is still meeting at the following time and place on Monday:

Date: 27/07/2015
Time: 3pm
Address: BSix Sixth Form College, Kenninghall Road, London, E5 8BP

We are sorry to change {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s accommodation at such late notice. The safety of participants is our main concern and we have high standards for our accommodation. Due to a recent change in the standard of {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s original accommodation, we have been forced to move to a new venue. We are really sorry for any confusion or problems caused by this late change.

If you have any other questions or would like to discuss this further, please call us on 0203 542 2400.

Yours sincerely,
Jo Lunt
Customer Services Manager
