Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

Date: 12/09/2015
Time: 9:30am
Address: The Bordesley Centre, Stratford Road, Birmingham, B11 1AR

We are extremely sorry to change your meeting point at such late notice. Due to a recent change in the availability of {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s original meeting point, we have been forced to move to a new venue. We are really sorry for any confusion or problems caused by this late change.
