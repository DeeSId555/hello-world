Correction to information for graduation
this weekend


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We recently sent you an invite through the post for {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s graduation event.

We are writing to let you know that the name of the venue on your graduation invite was missing.

The full details for {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s graduation venue are as follows:

SOAS
Vernon Square, Penton Rise,  London, WC1X 9EW.

All other graduation details remain the same (time, location and so on), so please refer to your original invite for further information. We will also send {!Contact.FirstName} an SMS with their graduation details.

We are very sorry for any confusion or inconvenience caused by this miscommunication. Please call us on 0203 542 2400 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further.

Yours sincerely,
Jo Lunt
Customer Services Manager
