DON&apos;T MISS OUT!

LAST FEW PLACES FOR NCS FEB 2015

Dear {!Contact.Name},

Don’t miss your once in a lifetime opportunity with NCS this February half term. We have a few places left in your area for the NCS programme which is running between 14 and 20 February - if you sign up before 8 Feb we’ll enter you into a prize draw to win a Minirig portable speaker system!

Sign up here: https://bookings.ncsthechallenge.org/

Want to know more about NCS? – Don’t just take our word for it - Here’s a short film which describes it by people who have already taken part.

WORRIED ABOUT MOCKS?

If you&apos;re worried about fitting NCS in over half term with mocks, course work and everything else - don’t be! We know about these and have designed our programme so you have free time and a break before the end of half term.

There’s lots more information on our website  or if you&apos;re ready, you can sign up here: https://bookings.ncsthechallenge.org/

If you’re interested in what other people have said about NCS, you can find us on Facebook and Twitter.
