Change in meeting point on 3rd August 2015


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

Your meeting point and accommodation for NCS Part 2 have changed from the details on the timetable sent to you previously.

The new details for {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s meeting point are as follows:

Date: 03/08/2015
Time: 4pm
Address: Spotlight Youth Centre, 30 Hay Currie Street, E14 6GN

{!Contact.FirstName} will now be staying at Ewen Henderson Court.

We will take {!Contact.FirstName} from the above meeting point to their new accommodation.

We are extremely sorry to change your meeting point at such late notice. The safety of participants is our main concern and we have high standards for our accommodation. Due to a recent change in the standard of {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s original accommodation, we have been forced to move to a new venue. We are really sorry for any confusion or problems caused by this late change.

If you have any other questions or would like to discuss this further, please call us on 0203 542 2400.

Yours sincerely,
Jo Lunt
Customer Services Manager
