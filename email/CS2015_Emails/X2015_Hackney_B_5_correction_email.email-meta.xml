Change in meeting point on 20th July 2015


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

Your meeting point for NCS Part 2 has changed from the details on the timetable sent to you previously.

The new details for {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s meeting point are as follows:

Date: 20/07/2015
Time: 5pm
Address: Ewen Henderson Court, 40 Goodwood Rd, London, SE14 6BL

We are extremely sorry to change your meeting point at such late notice. The safety of participants is our main concern and we have high standards for our accommodation. Due to a recent change in the standard of {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s original accommodation, we have been forced to move to a new venue. We are really sorry for any confusion or problems caused by this late change.

If getting to Ewen Henderson Court is going to be difficult or not possible, please call us on 0203 542 2400 and we will talk to you about other options. We are aware this late change may cause problems and will do all we can to support young people in getting to the new venue.

If you have any other questions or would like to discuss this further, please call us on the number above.

Yours sincerely,
Jo Lunt
Customer Services Manager
