Say YES to NCS



Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Recently {!Contact.FirstName} expressed an interest in doing NCS. {!Contact.FirstName} can take part in this once-in-a-lifetime experience during February half term and, if this isn’t convenient, there are also several start dates over the summer to choose from. *

You may have seen some of our recent TV ads which feature parents talking about what their son or daughter has gained from NCS…

Yours sincerely,
