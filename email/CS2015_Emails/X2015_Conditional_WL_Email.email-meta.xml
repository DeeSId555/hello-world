{!Contact.FirstName} is on the waiting list for NCS


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

{!Contact.FirstName} is on the waiting list for NCS (National Citizen Service)

Thank you for {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS. It is a popular programme so at the moment {!Contact.FirstName} is on the waiting list. However, they still have a good chance of getting a place.

What are my next steps?

If you pay now, we will be able to process {!Contact.FirstName}’s application more quickly if a place comes up for them. Thanks to government backing all you need to pay for NCS is a {!NCS_Application__c.Amount_due_outstanding__c} admin fee. {!NCS_Application__c.Email_WL_DD_payment_due__c}

To make a payment, log in to our website at https://bookings.the-challenge.org and go to the payment section, call us on 0203 542 2400 or send a cheque with the young person’s name written clearly on the back in the freepost envelope provided. If you need help with the cost, log in to your online account and select the financial assistance option in the payment section or call us.

If you have any questions, you can call us on 0203 542 2400, or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org.

How can I increase {!Contact.FirstName}’s chances of getting a place?

Simply log in to your online account at https://bookings.the-challenge.org to see if there are other programme dates that may be suitable for {!Contact.FirstName}. The website will let you add extra dates. Or, you can contact us directly to discuss this. The more dates you add, the greater {!Contact.FirstName}’s chance of taking part in NCS. If you are happy for {!Contact.FirstName} to travel to a programme which is further away and may have places available, you can also contact us to discuss this.

When will I find out more?

We will call you if a place becomes available. Places can become available at any time, right up to the programme start date. If we are not able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place, you can of course get a full refund.

We hope to be able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place soon.

Yours sincerely,
