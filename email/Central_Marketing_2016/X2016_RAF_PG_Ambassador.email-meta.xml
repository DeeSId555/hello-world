Dear {!IF&quot;(!Contact.Parent_Name__c)&quot;=&quot;&quot; &quot;Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName}&quot; &quot;{!Contact.Parent_Name__c}&quot;

We hope – {!Contact.FirstName} - had a great time taking part in NCS last year. We would love to hear more about their experience.

If you’re happy to send over a brief quote to describe {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s experience on NCS it would really help us encourage other schools and students to take part in the programme.
You can do this simply by emailing your quote to ncsquote@the-challenge.org

Referring friends:
You also have the chance to share your unique code with any friends or family who would like to sign up their young person.*

How it works:
When someone uses your code to sign up they will pay the discounted price of £35. You will also automatically receive a £20 Love2Shop voucher which can be used in a variety of stores and restaurants including John Lewis, Marks and Spencer and Pizza Hut.**
