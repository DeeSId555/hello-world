Dear {!IF&quot;(!Contact.Parent_Name__c)&quot;=&quot;&quot; &quot;Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName}&quot; &quot;{!Contact.Parent_Name__c}&quot; 

It’s great to hear that {!Contact.FirstName} has a place on NCS this summer. You now have the chance to share your unique referral code with any friends or family who would like to sign their young person up.* 

How it works:
When someone uses your code to sign up they will pay the discounted price of £35. If that wasn’t enough, you will also automatically receive a £20 Love2Shop voucher (link Love2Shop website) which can be used in a variety of stores and restaurants including John Lewis, Marks and Spencer and Pizza Hut.** 

What to do:
Send the below code onto anyone that would like to sign up.
{!Contact.Promotional_Code__c} 
We are really looking forward to seeing {!Contact.FirstName} on NCS this summer.
