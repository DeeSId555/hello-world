Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

To help you as you arrive attached are a couple of useful maps. Free parking is available in the main car park to the west of the stadium which is accessed via the entrance on Rugby Road. The entrance to the Live Room in the South Stand is at point no.1 on the attached Twickenham Stadium Site Map. For other directions please look at the attached Twickenham Stadium Road Access Map.

We look forward to seeing you tomorrow. 

Best wishes,

The Challenge.
