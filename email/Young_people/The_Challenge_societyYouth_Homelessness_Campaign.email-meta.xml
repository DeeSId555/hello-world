 Dear {!Contact.FirstName}
 
 
Come and be part of an exciting event on Monday 19th December, to help raise awareness about youth homelessness in West London. Meet at the Irish Cultural Centre, Blacks Road, Hammersmith, W6 9DT at 5pm to find out all about this issue from an Ambassador from St. Mungo&apos;s homeless charity. You&apos;ll then walk across the road to Lyric Square for a flash mob using sleeping bags and cardboard boxes. Whilst in the square you will highlight the important work that St Mungoâ€™s do in your local community. After the event you will head back to the venue for some festive food, drinks and music till 9.30pm - a chance to catch up with your friends.Make a difference and be there!
