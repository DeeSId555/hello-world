Don’t miss out on an experience of a lifetime for £50 or less

Hey {!Contact.FirstName}!

It was great to meet you the other day. Your NCS journey starts here. Then you can look forward to stuff like this…
What does the NCS programme look like?

Part 1 - Get Active:
Four days (three nights) staying away from home in the countryside doing outdoor adventure activities like canoeing, hiking, and rock climbing with your new teammates.

Part 2 - Get Involved:
Three days (staying at home at night) developing skills in either drama, enterprise, media, music, photography, art or sport. You&apos;ll also work with organisations or local businesses to get involved in the community around you.

Part 3- Make Your Mark:
Four weekend activity days (staying at home at night) where you and your team create your own project to benefit the local area, using funding you pitch for.

NCS teaches you lessons you really don’t learn in class!

You can kick-start your application using your unique login details:

Your NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Your password {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}
