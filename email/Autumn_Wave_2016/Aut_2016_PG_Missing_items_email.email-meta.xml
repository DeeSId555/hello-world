NCS application - your next steps

Dear {!IF(Contact.Parent_Name__c &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;&amp; ( Contact.Parent_Name__c ) &amp;&quot; &quot;,&quot;Parent or Guardian of (Contact.FirstName)&quot;)},

Please complete {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS

Thank you for starting {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for National Citizen Service (NCS). At the moment, parts of this are not complete and we cannot give {!Contact.FirstName} a place until we have received and reviewed these parts. So, we need you ({!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s parent or legal guardian) to provide:

{!NCS_Application__c.Missing_Item_MASI__c}{!NCS_Application__c.Missing_Item_Consent__c}

{!NCS_Application__c.Missing_Item_DOB__c}

{!NCS_Application__c.Missing_Item_School__c}

{!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;&quot;, &quot;&amp;(NCS_Application__c.Missing_payment_paragraph__c)&amp;&quot;&quot;&amp;(NCS_Application__c.Missing_Payment_SDD_Not_in_Past__c)&amp;&quot;&quot;&amp;(NCS_Application__c.Missing_Payment_with_Bursary_Call_Due__c)&amp;&quot;&quot;&amp;(NCS_Application__c.Missing_Payment_Bursary_Call_Made__c)&amp;&quot;)}

The easiest way to do this and complete {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s application is by logging in to your online account at bookings.ncsthechallenge.org. If you are unable to complete it online or have any questions, please call us on 0203 542 2400 – we’re always happy to help.

{!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;Please complete &quot;&amp;(Contact.FirstName)&amp;&quot;’s application as soon as possible so they can take part in this NCS programme as part of their course.&quot;,&quot;Places are filling up fast, so please complete &quot;&amp;(Contact.FirstName)&amp;&quot;’s application as soon as possible to increase their chances of benefiting from this once-in-a-lifetime experience.&quot;)}
