NCS application - your next steps

Dear {!IF(Contact.Parent_Name__c &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;&amp; ( Contact.Parent_Name__c ) &amp;&quot; &quot;,&quot;Parent or Guardian of (Contact.FirstName)&quot;)},

Your admin fee for {!Contact.FirstName}’s NCS application 

Thank you for your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in National Citizen Service (NCS) as part of their course. We have temporarily saved them a provisional place on the programme but you now need to pay your admin fee, which will be a maximum of £50. 

To pay, please:
log in to our website at bookings.ncsthechallenge.org (If you have forgotten your log in details, you can recover them by clicking &apos;login&apos; and then clicking the &quot;Forgotten password?&quot; button), or

call us on 0203 542 2400 to pay over the phone or arrange sending us a cheque.
We will then be able to continue processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s application. 

We wouldn’t want the cost to stop {!Contact.FirstName} taking part, so if finding the money is a problem, we may be able to help. Please log in to your online account, go to the payment section and select the option to ask for financial assistance. Alternatively, give us a call and we will be happy to advise you. 

Yours sincerely, 

The NCS Team - The Challenge
