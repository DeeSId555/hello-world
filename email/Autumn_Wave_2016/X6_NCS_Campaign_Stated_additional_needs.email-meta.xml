NCS - Sign up now

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thanks for letting us know you&apos;re interested in NCS. We are the Challenge and we run NCS in your area. Here are your next steps. 

Completing your application
Click sign up and login with the following:

Your NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Your young person password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

Your parent or guardian will need to fill in the main part of your application. They will be asked to fill in a medical and support information form about you. If you’re not sure who can complete your application form, please check our website. 

It’s quicker to apply online but if you would like a paper application form, please contact us using the details below. 

Any questions?
You may find your answer in our FAQs. Or, feel free to get in touch by using the details below. 

We may also be in touch with your parent or guardian once we have received your application but this will not affect your place.* 

We hope you sign up for this once in a lifetime experience!
