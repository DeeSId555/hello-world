What does the NCS programme look like?*

Part 1 - Get Active:
Four days (three nights) staying away from home in the countryside doing outdoor adventure activities like canoeing, hiking, and rock climbing with your new teammates. 

Part 2 - Get Involved:
Three days (staying at home at night) developing skills in either drama, enterprise, media, music, photography, art or sport. You will also work with organisations or local businesses to get involved in the community around you. 

Part 3- Make Your Mark:
Four weekend activity days in November (staying at home at night) where you and your team create your own project to benefit the local area and pitch your ideas to a panel of judges to win funding for it. You then use this funding to make your ideas come to life by carrying out your team project in the local community. 

NCS teaches you lessons you really don’t learn in class!
