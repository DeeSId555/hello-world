Don’t miss out on NCS - your admin fee

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

{!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;&quot;,&quot;It’s great that you want to take part in National Citizen Service (NCS) – but we don’t want you to miss out because of a missing admin fee!

&quot;)} {!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;We’ve contacted your parent or guardian to explain that we’ve received your application to take part in NCS, as part of your course, and saved you a place. We’ve let them know that they need to pay the &quot;+TEXT(Contact.Amount_due_outstanding__c)+&quot; admin fee. This discounted fee will go up to £50 after &quot;+TEXT(Contact.School_s_discount_deadline__c)+&quot;.&quot;,&quot;We’ve contacted your parent or guardian to explain that we’ve temporarily saved you a provisional place on NCS but they need to pay your admin fee to keep your provisional place. Remember, your NCS admin fee will be a maximum of £50.&quot;)}

We also explained how they can ask for financial assistance if they need help with the cost, because we would never want the cost to stop you taking part.

{!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;So, please ask your parent or guardian to pay or to contact us with any problems.&quot;,&quot;We can only save your provisional place on NCS until &quot;+TEXT(Contact.Letter_email_date_reserved_place_lost__c)+&quot; without this payment, so please ask your parent or guardian to pay or to contact us if they need any help with the payment so we can have a chat.&quot;)} They can pay by:
logging in to their account on our website at bookings.ncsthechallenge.org, or
calling us on 0203 542 2400 to pay over the phone, or arrange sending us a cheque.

{!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;This is part of your college course so make sure you get this done!

&quot;,&quot;&quot;)} Any questions?
Get in touch by emailing us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org or calling us on 0203 542 2400.

{!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;&quot;,&quot;Speak to your parent or guardian as soon as you can to give yourself the best chance of taking part in this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

&quot;)} {!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;Have a great week!&quot;,&quot;Kind regards,&quot;)}
