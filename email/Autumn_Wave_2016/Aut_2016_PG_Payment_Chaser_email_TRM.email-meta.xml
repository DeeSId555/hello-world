{!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;&quot;,&quot;Places on NCS are in high demand so if we have not received the payment by &quot;+TEXT(NCS_Application__c.Letter_email_date_reserved_place_lost__c)+&quot;, we may have to move &quot;&amp;(Contact.FirstName)&amp;&quot; to the waiting list and give the place to another young person.

&quot;)} {!IF((Contact.Term_time_wave__c == TRUE),&quot;Thank you for your application for &quot;&amp;(Contact.FirstName)&amp;&quot; to take part in National Citizen Service (NCS) as part of their course.

Remember your NCS admin fee will be a maximum of £50.&quot;)}
