Don’t miss out on NCS - info needed!

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Now that you&apos;ve said yes to NCS, this is what you could have in store...

Don&apos;t miss out on this because of an unfinished application!

We’ve sent your parent or guardian a letter or email explaining that they need to complete parts of your NCS application. As we can’t save you a place until this happens, please ask your parent or guardian to complete your application. 

They will have a list of what we need in the letter or email we sent, along with instructions on how to do it. You can see which parts of your application we need your parent or guardian to do by logging in to your young person&apos;s account here. 

Any questions?
We&apos;re here to help - you can email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org or call us on 0203 542 2400. 

Places are filling up fast, so speak to your parent or guardian as soon as you can to give yourself the best chance of having this once-in-a-lifetime experience. 

Kind regards, 

The NCS Team - The Challenge
