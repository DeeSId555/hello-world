Well done from HeadStart!

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for taking part in the HeadStart programme.

Unfortunately, the deadline for logging your hours to be eligible for a job interview has now passed.

You can, however, use your hours towards the Challenge with Distinction award, as well as accessing all sorts of amazing opportunities through The Challenge Society.  Check out what is happening in your area here:

TCS West London

TCS South London

TCS North East London

Remember that the HeadStart programme is about developing employability skills through volunteering and that you can use your experience for any future job you may apply to.

You have made such a difference to your community and the charity you have given your time to - well done and thank you!

Best wishes

The HeadStart Team
