An exclusive opportunity for YOU from The Challenge…


Dear {!Contact.FirstName}


We hope you had a fantastic time on your NCS journey in the summer and Real Challenge Action weekends.


You are now eligible to apply for HeadStart - a new programme The Challenge has developed in partnership with the Mayor of London to give you the skills and experience to get ahead. HeadStart offers an exciting way for you to build on the experiences you’ve gained over the last three weeks, whilst getting back together with friends from your wave.

The HeadStart programme is made up of three simple steps:

Volunteer for at least 16 hours with a local charity. We’ll help you find the volunteering opportunity that fits with your interests and your free time.

Engage in exclusive skills workshops, developed with leading employers to give you the right skills and aptitude to get ahead.

Get a guaranteed interview for a paid part-time/seasonal job with New Look, Starbucks or Lloyd’s Banking Group, or an exclusive paid internship with the Mayor of London’s office or Zendesk.


HeadStart will help you:

Gain skills and experience

Be more employable

Stand out on your UCAS form

Meet new people and get back together with friends from NCS
