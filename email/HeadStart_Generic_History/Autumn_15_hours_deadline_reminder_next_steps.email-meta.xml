    <textOnly>Dear {!HS_Activity__c.YP_First_name_from_HS_Application_Form__c},


Happy new year! We hope you had a magical Christmas.

There’s still time to complete 16 hours or more of volunteering before the deadline, on 31st January, 2016.


What’s in it for me?

Great question.  Well for a start, volunteering can make you  feel all warm and fuzzy inside and believe it or not, you are helping London/Birmingham become a better place!

Secondly, it will allow you to gain access to our exclusive skills building workshops.  These will help you to stand out from the crowd.  Volunteering paired with the workshops  gives you the ultimate combination of skills that you need to get ahead.

Not only do you get all that, but there is the added bonus of a guaranteed job interview with your chosen employer.  This is a great opportunity to practice your interview skills and learn how to talk about your volunteering experience.  We can’t guarantee you’ll get the job of course. That all depends on you and store availability but to even get the chance at an interview is invaluable.

So what are you waiting for? Volunteer, log your hours on the HeadStart website, get ahead,  simple!

What’s next?

Once you’ve completed your hours, we will send out invitations for workshops and interviews. The date and time of your workshop will depend on which employer you have chosen.

We can only invite you to workshops and interviews once you have completed 16 hours or more of volunteering so keep it up and log those hours after each session!


In case you&apos;ve forgotten, we&apos;ve included the HeadStart journey map for you to have a look at again.
