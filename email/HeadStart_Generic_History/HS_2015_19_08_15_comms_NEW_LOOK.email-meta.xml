Welcome to the start of your New Look journey!
Now for the exciting part - your first steps as a New Look Sales Advisor! We have three exciting workshops for you to attend that will provide you with all the information you need to know about New Look, your upcoming interview and provide some great communication coaching that will be invaluable for any future interview you may attend.
