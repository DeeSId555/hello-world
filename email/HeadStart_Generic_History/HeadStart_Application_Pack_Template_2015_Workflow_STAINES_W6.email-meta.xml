Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


It was great to meet you last week at Showcase - it was a fantastic event. We hope you are enjoying the rest of your time on NCS.  We have an exclusive opportunity for you to take part in HeadStart summer 2015 - this is only available for Staines and Slough graduates this week! This is a fantastic chance to continue your NCS journey.


Click HERE to apply.


The deadline for applications is midnight Sunday 9th August. Places with HeadStart charity partners - particularly those ran with The Challenge - are limited so apply early to avoid disappointment. You will need your email address / NCS ID, and the below PIN to log in to the site. You will need to type your email exactly as it is here as it is case sensitive.


Email Address: {!Contact.Email}

NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}

PIN: {!Contact.Login_Password__c}

Any questions? Email the HeadStart team, check out our website or get in touch on facebook.

We look forward to receiving your application!


Emily
