Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Well done on logging {!HS_Activity__c.HS_Hours_Total__c} hours of volunteering! This is such a great achievement ! Not only have you learnt new skills which will be useful for your future, you have also given up your time to help your local community so you should feel very proud.

Remember, if you have found your own placement and haven’t yet told us about it, please email headstart@the-challenge.org to let us know where you have been volunteering as we will need to verify your hours.
