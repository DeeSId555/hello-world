Final Chance to Apply for HeadStart!

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

The Birmingham HeadStart programme has re-opened applications for 3 days only until midnight on Sunday 11th October.
HeadStart is a programme run by The Challenge that guarantees you an interview for a part-time job once you have completed 16 hours of volunteering. It will also massively help your UCAS application and/or CV.
There are places left for those applicants who can find their own volunteering opportunity and there will be a waiting list for those who choose volunteering opportunities from the website. These will be filled as places become available.
