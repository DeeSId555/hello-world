Well done from HeadStart!

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations for logging your volunteering hours! You have made such a difference to your local community and the charity that you have been supporting and should be really proud of your achievements.

We now have some additional placements available with Zendesk, due to take place in the Easter holidays. As you logged your hours before the deadline, you are now eligible to attend these second round of interviews.

Your next steps:

We will be verifying your hours with your charity partner. If you’ve not yet given us the details of where you have been volunteering please email headstart@the-challenge.org
We will invite you to reapply for the Zendesk role, when applications open

Congratulations again and remember you can continue volunteering if you wish to and keep logging those hours on the HeadStart website!

We will be in touch with more information as it becomes available.


Best wishes

HeadStart Team
