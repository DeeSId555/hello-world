Welcome to the start of your Zendesk journey!
Now for the exciting part - the first steps towards your Zendesk Work Experience! There are three steps to your Zendesk recruitment process, starting with two exciting workshops next week that will tell you everything you need to know about Zendesk, your potential upcoming interview and some great communication coaching that will be invaluable for any future interview you may attend.
Next steps...
The three recruitment steps are confirmed below:

Workshops: Zendesk Workshop and AGL Communications Coaching
Zendesk Online Application
The Interview

In order to qualify for an interview you will need to complete both the Zendesk Workshop and Online Application. Full details for both can be found below.
Booking your Workshops and Online Application
Book your place on the Zendesk Workshop and AGL Communications Coaching using the link below:
ZENDESK WORKSHOP SIGN UP LINK
Before being eligible to attend an interview you also need to complete a brief Online Application form, the link for which can be found below. Please TAKE YOUR TIME when completing the Questionnaire and think carefully about your answers, emphasising your volunteering and NCS experience wherever possible, using examples and linking these to the specific question you are answering.
https://docs.google.com/a/zendesk.com/forms/d/1uTJ3p5PWN_gTs7LBePa2slWX_Np2pU_oS6B5MB7TyvA/viewform?usp=send_form
The DEADLINE for completing the application will be Tuesday 25th August, but we would suggest you try and complete it as soon as possible. Due to a limited number of work experience placements available during the October half term, a group of successful candidates will then be invited to attend the Zendesk Interview based on your scores from the Online Application, so it is vital you take your time to complete it. Anyone who isn&apos;t successful will then have the opportunity to attend an interview during the next wave of placements available with Zendesk taking place during the Easter Holiday 2016.
Next Steps and Interview Date Reminder
Once you have attended the Workshops next week and completed your Online Application, Zendesk will then be contacting successful candidates directly next Wednesday to confirm your place on the interview day. This will take place on Friday the 28th of August (1230-1430) at the Zendesk Office in Paddington. MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THIS DATE AND TIME FREE!
Thank you for choosing Zendesk as your prefered job choice.  The chance to change preferance has now passed.  If you have changed your job preference before 19/8/15 to something else please ignore this email.


If you have any further questions please go get in contact with us. Otherwise, keep clocking up those volunteering hours and get yourself booked on your workshops as soon as possible! We look forward to seeing you all next week!
