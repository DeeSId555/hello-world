    <textOnly>Hi {!partnername},

Thank you so much for hosting {!young.person} this Summer. We sincerely hope you’ve found their time with you helpful and rewarding.

We would be extremely grateful if you could take a second to complete the succinct survey below, to tell us whether the volunteering hours [!contact.first.name} has logged are an accurate representation of the time they spent assisting you.

It is really important that these hours are verified, as it will ensure that everyone who has achieved at least 16 hours and is deserving of a job interview is rightfully given the opportuity to access one.

HeadStart will be running again from October half term until the end of January, so if you haven&apos;t yet spoken to us about hosting some more volunteers but would be interested in doing so, then please don&apos;t hesitate to contact us at headstart@the-challenge.org.


A huge thank you again for offering some keen young volunteers the opportunity to gain invaluable new skills and experiences.


Kind regards,

The HeadStart team
