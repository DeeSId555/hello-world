Engage in exclusive skills workshops, developed with leading employers to give you the right skills and aptitude to get ahead, including expert communications coaching and interview preparation sessions.

Get a guaranteed interview for a part-time/seasonal job with New Look, Starbucks or Lloyds Banking Group, or an exclusive paid internship with the Mayor of London&apos;s office or Zendesk.



Applications for HeadStart open on 13th November!
