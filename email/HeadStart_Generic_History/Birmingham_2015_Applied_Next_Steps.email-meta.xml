Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for joining HeadStart! We&apos;re really excited to have you on the programme, and just wanted to send you a little email saying &quot;what happens next&quot;

In the next two weeks we&apos;ll be assigning you to one of your volunteer choices, after this you&apos;ll get a call from us confirming your charity and first day of volunteering.
You will then get an email with all the details you need and some information on how to get a ticket for our HeadStart Kick Off event.

SAVE THE DATE

HeadStart Kick Off

Saturday 24th October or Monday 26th October
