Dear {!HS_Activity__c.YP_First_name_from_HS_Application_Form__c},

We’re guessing you must be really busy with School, College or just general life stuff.  That’s why we’ve decided to extend the time limit you have to complete 16 hours of volunteering.

Yep, we’re that nice!  We also don’t want you to miss this unique opportunity to get ahead and take advantage of all the great workshops HeadStart has to offer, not to mention the added bonus of a guaranteed interview with your chosen employer.

You now have until the [insert date here] to complete at least 16 hours of volunteering.  Remember to log your hours on the HS website each time you volunteer.

Trouble logging your volunteering hours or have a question to ask?

Email: HeadStart@the-challenge.org

Good luck!
