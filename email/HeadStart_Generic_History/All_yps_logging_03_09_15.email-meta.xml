Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Your Hours

Well done on completing {!HS_Activity__c.HS_Hours_Total__c} hours of volunteering! We hope you’re enjoying your volunteering and learning a range of transferable skills that will be useful during your interview.

If you think your hours are incorrect try submitting again here or email headstart@the-challenge.org and let us know.


Top Tips

We understand you’re back to college/school so here’s some tips on how to manage your time. We don’t want you to compromise studies but equally don’t want you to miss out on your interview!


Let your volunteering placement know you’re studying and ask if there are any other sessions available.

Work out which weekend days/evenings you might be able to volunteer in advance (asap!) and arrange with your volunteering contact.

Keep logging your hours so we can invite you to an interview.



Keep logging your hours, you can do this!

Any questions? Email the HeadStart team, check out our website or get in touch on facebook.
