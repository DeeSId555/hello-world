Great news - Another employment opportunity!

Dear {!HS_Activity__c.Young_Person__c},

We hope you enjoyed half term.

Once again, congratulations for coming this far in the process.  What you have achieved up until this point is something to be very proud of.  Here’s an update on what’s available to you through HeadStart.

Not passing your interview doesn’t mean it’s the end of the road! You’ll be happy to hear we have 2 very exclusive opportunities, only offered to HeadStart candidates.





HeadStart plan to host a Graduate Event for candidates who did not secure a HeadStart job in December, to celebrate all of your achievements and to support you in your next steps, with potential workshops on LinkedIn and CV building. If you would like to register your interest, please click here.  Spaces are limited.


We hope to hear from you very soon.


If you have any queries, please email headstart@the-challenge.org</textOnly>
