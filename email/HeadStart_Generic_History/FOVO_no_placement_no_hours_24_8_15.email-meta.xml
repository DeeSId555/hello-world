Are you volunteering? Let HeadStart know!

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Do you still want a guaranteed interview for a part-time job with a HeadStart employer? If so, you need to log 16 hours of volunteering before 18th September!

There’s still time. Here’s what you need to do:


Know where you’re volunteering?

Great! Please give us the details by completing this form and remember to log your hours ASAP on the HeadStart website. You need to log 16 hours of volunteering by 18th September in order to be invited to an interview for a part-time job. It only takes a few minutes. Your login details are at the top of this email.


Haven’t started volunteering yet?

Not to worry! There’s still time to complete your 16 hours of volunteering before the 18th September by finding your own volunteering opportunity. It’s really straightforward to do and we have created a brief guide to help you. We’ve also written a short letter of introduction for you to print and take with you to any potential charity to explain what HeadStart is.


Once you’ve found a place to volunteer, please complete this form to let us know the name of the organisation, key contact and phone number. Please do this ASAP to give yourself plenty of time to complete your volunteering.

Any questions? Email the HeadStart team, check out our website or get in touch on facebook.
