What is Kick Off?

This is an event put on by the HeadStart team to help you get ahead in the programme and give you a chance to meet all HeadStart participants.

Kick Off part one: an introduction to the programme.  This will break down all important information you will need for the next few months and how you can make the most of your volunteering placement.

Kick Off part two: the workshop. This will be an interactive session full of group and individual tasks.  The workshop will enable you to further develop your skills and get an idea of what you’re working towards in terms of your possible work placement.

Important information

You only need to book one time slot for Kick Off. Places are limited so make sure you’re not double booking.

Bring all your questions as the team will be available to answer them for you. We want to help you have fun, learn and really get the most out of your opportunity.

If you have any questions before then, please contact us on; headstart@the-challenge.org

Best wishes

HeadStart team
