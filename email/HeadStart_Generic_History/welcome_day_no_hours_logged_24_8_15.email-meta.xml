HeadStart needs YOU to log your hours!

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Remember to log your hours on the HeadStart website


There’s still time. Here’s what you need to do:


We hope you’re enjoying your volunteering placement. In order to be invited to an interview with a HeadStart employer, you must log 16 hours of volunteering by 18th September.

Forgotten how to log your hours!?


Your Login details are at the top of this email!

Click here to log your hours

Click on the red ‘log your hours’ button

Make sure you log your hours, including the minutes, even if it’s 0 (otherwise it won’t save!) eg. 1 hour. 0 minutes.


Remember that attending your welcome session also counts towards your 16 hour target so you can log this too!


If you’re concerned that you won’t complete your volunteering in time, please email headstart@the-challenge.org and we can look at your options.

Any questions? Email the HeadStart team, check out our website or get in touch on facebook.
