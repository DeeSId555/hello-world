Your chance to become a Fixer!

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We are writing to you today with an amazing opportunity for HeadStart graduates living in Hounslow and Spelthorne with an amazing organization...

Young People Using Their Past to Fix the Future!

Fixers work in regions across the UK with young people aged 16-25 years on an issue they are passionate about. It can be a group or an individual that want to do a project that is important to them.

We meet with you, hear what you are interested in/what issues they want to make a difference to; we then work with the you on your project idea, helping to refine ideas before we get our Creative Team involved to help to develop the resource most appropriate for the &apos;fix&apos;. We then help the you to get your resource out as far and wide as possible to the right people. Resources that have been created include; short films and animations, one off events, website, leaflets and posters, and many more (you can see some of them on our website here).

Why should YOU get involved?

We never say no to a project, as long as the project helps at least one other person!
Gives you the opportunity to develop  valuable skills for both personal and professional development
Many Fixers’ projects have gone on to become national campaigns and are achieving nationally recognised awards.
All the projects are funded by us and no one taking part should have to spend money to get involved. We cover all expenses.
