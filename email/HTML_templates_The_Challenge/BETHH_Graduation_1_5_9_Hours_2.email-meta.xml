INVITATION TO YOUR GRADUATION

Dear {!Contact.Name},

Updated hours email


You are warmly invited to The Challenge Graduation Ceremony along with a guest. At the event you and your team will be awarded your graduation certificates and become official graduates of The Challenge, as well as graduates of the National Citizen Service (NCS).



Now that the September weekends have finished, we have totalled up any hours you have to make up before you can graduate. You have a total of {!Contact.Hours_required_for_graduation__c} hours. You can make up these hours with any charity or organisation, such as the ones you have got to know over the summer. Ask your friends or family members in case they know of any local charities or organisations that would be suitable. You would need to provide the details of someone at the organisation who we can contact to verify your attendance (this should not be a family member).



Everyone who has completed the summer programme (including those who have made up any lost hours) will be eligible to receive their certificate.  If you make up your hours, you and your team will be awarded your graduation certificates and become official graduates of The Challenge, as well as graduates of National Citizen Service (NCS).



We would love to see you there, even if you haven’t made up your hours yet! Whilst you will not be able to receive your certificate at the ceremony if you continue to submit your hours after graduation your certificate will be posted to you once all of these hours have been logged.



So now you have completed The Challenge, you might be wondering what’s next? The good news is, this is not the end… it’s only the beginning! An exciting part of Graduation is the launch of The Challenge Society – giving you the chance to stay involved in so many more new and exciting ways. So if you want to keep this amazing experience going don’t miss, &quot;The Big Sleep Out&quot; coming to a town near you on November 17th! This is a fantastic opportunity for you to reunite, stay involved and have fun!


We look forward to seeing you at Graduation!
