Take on The Challenge this summer


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope {!Contact.FirstName} is excited about the prospect of taking on The Challenge this summer!

Please find below a link to {!Contact.FirstName}’s information pack, containing everything they need to know before The Challenge begins. You will find a full schedule including all of {!Contact.FirstName}’s meeting locations and times, as well as a comprehensive packing list and answers to some frequently asked questions. In the unlikely event that a venue should be shown on your timetable as “to be confirmed”, please be assured that your local team will be in touch with you as soon as the details are finalised.

{!Wave_Selection__c.Girl_only_wave_prog_email_sentence__c}You may also be invited to an information evening about the programme, which will be held in the weeks leading up to {!Contact.FirstName} beginning The Challenge.  Both parents and participants in {!Contact.FirstName}’s group will be invited, so that we can go through all the details with you and give you a chance to ask us any last-minute questions. We will send you the date, time and location of this evening nearer the time. Please note that if you are unable to attend or you are receiving this email after the date of the information evening, all of the information you need is contained in the links below, and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further queries.

As the largest provider of the National Citizen Service, we hope that {!Contact.FirstName} will be able to take on The Challenge, and we would encourage them to remind friends to complete their applications before the summer. In the meantime, please visit our Facebook page www.facebook.com/thechallengenetwork where you can find photos, comments, and competitions.

Please ensure the medical or dietary details that you have provided are up-to-date, and communicate any changes to us as soon as possible. Should any circumstance arise that would prevent {!Contact.FirstName} from attending The Challenge please let us know as far in advance as possible, in order to minimise wastage of high value places on the programme.

Your personalised timetable can be found here: {!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}. Our information booklet, containing everything you need to know about the summer, can be found here: http://my.page-flip.co.uk/?userpath=00000013/00012513/00083728
