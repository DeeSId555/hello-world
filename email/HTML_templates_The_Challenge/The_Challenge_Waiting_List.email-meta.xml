Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

Following our telephone conversation about your child&apos;s application for a place on The Challenge programme this summer, we are writing to confirm that {!Contact.FirstName} has been placed on a waiting list for the programme beginning on {!Wave_Selection__c.Wave_start_date__c}.

Please note that the programme you have selected may require {!Contact.FirstName} to travel to different areas local to you for the summer and autumn element of the programme. Exact details of the location and meeting points will be given to you closer to the time once you have been assigned a place and moved off the waiting list.

If you have any questions or for more information on the waiting list process, please contact us on 0330 111 0101 (free from mobiles) or visit our website www.the-challenge.org for more information.

We will be in touch as soon as a place becomes available.

Yours sincerely,

{!Account.OwnerFullName}
