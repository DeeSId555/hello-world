Take on NCS powered by The Challenge this autumn


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for beginning {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s application for NCS (National Citizen Service) with The Challenge. We are currently processing this and will be in touch with you in early autumn to discuss {!Contact.FirstName}â€™s place on the autumn programme.

The Challenge Network is the largest provider of NCS, a government-funded initiative. The autumn intensive NCS programme powered by The Challenge allows participants to fast-track their future and achieve all the benefits of the NCS programme in just one week.  NCS with The Challenge is the perfect way to get the very best out of Year 12 and beyond.

For anyone thinking about applying to university, NCS is on the UCAS website as a programme that admissions tutors like to see on application forms.

The Challenge&apos;s autumn NCS programme is a great way to build up skills to put on applications and CVs, with minimal impact on school or college.

We are delighted that {!Contact.FirstName} has decided to sign up for NCS with The Challenge. As places are limited, we would urge {!Contact.FirstName} to remind friends to take part in this unique and exciting opportunity.

We will be in touch in early autumn to update you on the application process. In the meantime, please visit www.the-challenge.org for videos and testimonials of previous participants. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us on 020 3542 2400.

Yours sincerely,

Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge Network
