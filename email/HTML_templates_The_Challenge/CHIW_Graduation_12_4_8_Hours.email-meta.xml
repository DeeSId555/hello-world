INVITATION TO YOUR GRADUATION

Dear {!Contact.Name},

Congratulations on your commitment and contribution to the challenge this summer!

You are warmly invited to The Challenge Graduation Ceremony along with a guest. At the event you and your team will be awarded your graduation certificates and become official graduates of The Challenge, as well as graduates of the National Citizen Service (NCS).

Before you graduate you will need to make up {!Contact.Hours_required_for_graduation__c} hours. You can make up these hours with any charity or organisation, such as the ones you have got to know over the summer. Ask your friends or family members in case they know of any local charities or organisations that would be suitable. You would need to provide the details of someone at the organisation who we can contact to verify your attendance (this should not be a family member).

Everyone who has completed the summer programme (including making up any lost hours) will be eligible to receive their certificate, but we would love to see you there, even if you haven’t made up your hours. If you make up your hours, you and your team will be awarded your graduation certificates and become official graduates of The Challenge, as well as graduates of National Citizen Service (NCS).

So now you have completed The Challenge, you might be wondering what’s next? The good news is, this is not the end… it’s only the beginning! An exciting part of Graduation is the launch of The Challenge Society – giving you the chance to stay involved in so many more new and exciting ways. So if you want to keep this amazing experience going don’t miss, &quot;The Big Sleep Out&quot; coming to a town near you on November 17th! This is a fantastic opportunity for you to reunite, stay involved and have fun!

Looking forward to seeing you at Graduation!
