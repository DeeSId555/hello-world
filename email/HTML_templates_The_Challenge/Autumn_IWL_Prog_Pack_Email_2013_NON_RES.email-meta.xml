Get ready to take on NCS with The Challenge


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope we can find {!Contact.FirstName} a place on NCS with The Challenge soon this autumn, and will keep you updated on programme availability.

So that you can both prepare for that possibility, please see a link below to {!Contact.FirstName}’s information pack, containing everything they need to know about NCS with The Challenge. You will also find a full schedule, packing list and answers to frequently asked questions. In the unlikely event that a venue is shown as “to be confirmed”, we will be in touch as soon as the details are finalised.

You will receive an invite to an information evening, in the weeks leading up to the programme, where we will go through all the details with you and give you a chance to ask any questions. If you are unable to attend, or are receiving this pack after the evening has taken place, all of the information that you need can be found in the links below.  In the meantime, please visit our Facebook page www.facebook.com/thechallengenetwork where to find photos, comments, and competitions.

As the largest provider of the National Citizen Service, we are looking forward to welcoming {!Contact.FirstName}  on The Challenge, and we would encourage {!Contact.FirstName}  to remind their friends to complete their applications before the summer.

Please ensure the medical or dietary details that you have provided are up-to-date, and communicate any changes to us as soon as possible. Should any circumstance arise that would prevent {!Contact.FirstName} from attending, please let us know as far in advance as possible, in order to minimise wastage of high value places.

Please do not hesitate to contact us on 020 3542 2400 or at contact@the-challenge.org if you have any questions or require any further information.

Your personalised timetable can be found here: {!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}. Our information booklet, containing everything you need to know about the Autumn programme, can be found here http://www.the-challenge.org/TC-NoRES_ProgrammeBooklet.html.

Yours sincerely,
