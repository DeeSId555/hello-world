Dear {!Contact.Name},

Congratulations on your commitment and contribution to the challenge this summer!

You are warmly invited to The Challenge Graduation Ceremony along with a guest. At the event you and your team will be awarded your graduation certificates and become official graduates of The Challenge, as well as graduates of the National Citizen Service (NCS).

So now you have completed The Challenge, you might be wondering what’s next? The good news is, this is not the end… it’s only the beginning! An exciting part of Graduation is the launch of The Challenge Society – giving you the chance to stay involved in so many more new and exciting ways. So if you want to keep this amazing experience going don’t miss, &quot;The Big Sleep Out&quot; coming to a town near you on November 17th! This is a fantastic opportunity for you to reunite, stay involved and have fun!

Looking forward to seeing you at Graduation!
