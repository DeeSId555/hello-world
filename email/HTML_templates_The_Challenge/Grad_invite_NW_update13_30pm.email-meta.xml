    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Further to our email of 8 October, we would like to apologise for the error contained within it. The email invited you to graduation on 25 October. This was an error. The correct graduation date is 27 October, not 25 October. We apologise for the confusion and any inconvenience that this has caused.

We confirm that the correct date of your graduation is Thursday, 27 October. 

We would be very grateful if you could re-confirm your attendance at graduation by clicking on the link below.
