    <subject>Challenge Action Teams - run your own project!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Want the chance to run your own social action project? Get involved and be a part of our CAT Teams! Challenge Action Teams are a great way for you to benefit your community by forming your own social action projects and being funded up to £500 to run them!

What are CAT Teams?

CAT Teams are social action teams made for you and your fellow grad mates to get creative and run social action projects on an issue that YOU are passionate about; you could be funded up to £500 to run your own project, it&apos;s all down to you!

How does it work?

If you want to get involved and run your own social action project, it&apos;s simple! You attend a session, bring your grad mates along, form a team and put forward your ideas on what social action project you would like to run. We will help you come up with a solid plan and on NCS Action Day your team will be pitching your idea to dragons to receive funding.

REMEMBER: The larger your team the greater your chance of receiving more funding.

When?

The first CAT Team meeting will be held on the 19th February 1pm-3pm at The Challenge Waterloo Office.
Address: Elizabeth House, Mezz Floor, 39 York Road, SE1 7NQ

Order you ticket here!

Please respond to this email letting us know that you are attending.
