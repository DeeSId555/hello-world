    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName}
Don&apos;t forget that this weekend, on SATURDAY, you and your NCS team will be taking to the streets to make your social action projects come to life! Over the weekends of September, you will be preparing your campaign materials, running your campaign, raising money for your social action project and volunteering to make it happen!

Keep an eye on your texts for full details on what you &amp; your team are doing this weekend and what you need to bring!

Be sure to send your best photos to the wave manager and share on Twitter @ChallengeEast with your wave &amp; team name, to see them on the graduate website!

Plus...

Each weekend, there will be a chance to win a prize for you and your team!! Full attendance, turning up on time and smashing your sponsorship are just a few ways to gain points to push you into the lead! You can start now - get asking all your friends and family to sponsor you to do your social action project!

And...

Visit TCSNORTHEASTLONDON.ORG for your wave photos and a sneak peak into what&apos;s on offer once NCS is over!

See you this weekend!
