    <subject>REMINDER: RYB Meeting THIS THURSDAY</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Regional Youth Boarders (RYB),

Great seeing some of you yesterday!

For those of you that were not able to make it we went over:

- Projects and the RYBs role on NCS Action Day
- Switching up our Marketing our Communications to NCS Graduates
- Sharing Pizza (soz to those that I ate their slices, it&apos;s all love)

Our next meeting will be on Thursday 4th of February. And we will be going through the following:

- Where and what should RYBs be doing on NCS Action Day
- Local Youth Boards reaction to proposed RYB projects
- Youth Proofing our communications
- Work experience opportunities and how you can lead these during the Half Term.

As I said I would like to get you guys to start leading these meetings so here are your roles:

Abiola - Chair
Liam - Icebreaker/Energizer
All - Bring some food, preferably cultural (Funsho and Kofi have to bring Jollof Rice)
All - If you have a friend that is not doing another NCS Grad role and think they would be good for the board, get them to send me an email and reference you as someone who suggested the opportunity to them!

Location: The Challenge HQ, 39 York Road, SE1 7NQ.
Time: 5:30pm - 7:30pm

Thanks team and see you then!
