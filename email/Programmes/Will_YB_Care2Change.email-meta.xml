Just in case you would like a reminder about our event:

A young carer is a young person who takes on the responsibilities of an adult at a young age in order to take care of a parent[s] or sibling[s] who has an illness or disease. This creates problems in taking on both the life of a young person [e.g. education and social life] and taking on the role of carer. This event will help YOU understand on what YOU can do to help a Young Carer. As YOU might know one.

This event has been organised and managed by your elected Youth-Board members.

Partners such as The YMCA, Spurgeons, Pyro Network and many more amazing organisations, will be supporting the event to discuss what they do for young carers.

Live music, food, drink and a chance to meet friends old and new.

Please also visit our Facebook and Twitter pages.

Hope to see you all there,
