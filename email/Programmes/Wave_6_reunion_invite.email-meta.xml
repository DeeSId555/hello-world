WAVE 6 REUNION! - CAT LAUNCH &amp; STAFF ASSESSORS

{!Contact.FirstName}

How would you improve your community with £300?

This is an opportunity for the grads of wave 6 to get together and have some fun, think of great ways to improve our communities, eat some pizza and help us choose next years mentors!

we will be forming an &apos;action team&apos; who will come up with a great idea to improve their communities and apply to the O2 think big for £300 funding. We are also needing graduates to help us assess mentors and team leaders to work with us in the summer. This is a great chance to get everone together, have a laugh and do something positive - EVERYBODY WINS!!

We&apos;d love to know if you are coming.
