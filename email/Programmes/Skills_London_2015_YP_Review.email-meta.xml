    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

You were one of the 500 young people that came by The Challenge&apos;s stand at Skills London 2015 to say &apos;Hi, I graduated from NCS&apos;  and sign up to our prize raffle. Thank you for making time for this, we hope you enjoyed the event!

We are curious to see how you benefited from attending this event, so please fill out this quick survey - https://docs.google.com/a/the-challenge.org/forms/d/1P1qzdS1nPb6kATrzWvL1diDKUGGVeI92uo0xs9AgX_8/viewform. This will really help us figure out how to improve your experience in the future.

Many thanks,

Sofia
