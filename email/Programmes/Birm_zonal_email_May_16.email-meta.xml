    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Our Associate Mentor applications have now closed for the year but whether you are going to be volunteering with us this summer or now, check out the great opportunities below

Register to vote

The biggest decision of our generation is happening on Thursday 23rd June: should the UK leave or stay in the EU?

Education, immigration, employment, the environment, trade, travel... it will all be impacted by the result.

Only 43% of young people voted in the 2015 General Election.  The Midlands has the youngest population in Europe, yet over half of under 25s won&apos;t get heard in the referendum unless we increase the number of young people who register and vote.

For impartial information and to find out how to register, check out uprising.org.uk
#RegisterToVote #EURef
Ministry Of Data is a DATA RAVE at Millennium Point, Birmingham, on Saturday 4th June 2016 from 8 - 11pm.
The event is designed to give young people a space to explore the EU referendum. It&apos;s a platform to discover information in an engaging way and to extract insight from young people to understand their perspective and viewpoint. Think of it as a living, breathing data event. Expect dancing, drinks, live visuals and sound mixing. Oh, and 6 foot balloons.

Free tickets here.

Paid roles available with the University of the First Age NCS Call centre.
