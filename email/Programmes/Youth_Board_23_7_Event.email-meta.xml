Happy Thursday {!Contact.Name}

As your Youth Board we know how much you enjoyed working with your charity partners on NCS, and we have another opportunity for you to be part of a completely youth-led initiative. This is in the form of a charity concert that we are organising for local care homes and isolated older people in Reading. We’re looking for volunteers and musicians to help make this unique event a success.

DETAILS:-

Saturday the 23rd of July from 1:30 to 16:30 (if you want to perform) and 14:00-17:30 (if you want to volunteer)

Saint Laurence Church, Friar St, Reading RG1 1DA

It is the Saturday after school breaks up for summer so it won’t interfere with exams, and the church is a 5 minute walk from Reading Station. We’re looking for volunteers to spend time socialising with guests, and also for those with an interest in music to perform at the concert.

Why should you do this??

We know how much you loved volunteering on NCS!

Socialise and engage with the older generation – something which many of us rarely get the chance to do!

It&apos;s a great chance to show off and develop your skills!

It gives you the opportunity to help combat social isolation
