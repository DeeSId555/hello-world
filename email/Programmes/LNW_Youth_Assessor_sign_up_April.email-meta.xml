    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

We had our very last Youth Assessor training today, so I&apos;m pleased to let you know that you are now officially part of the London North Youth Assessor team for 2016!

Below is an overview of the up-and-coming assessments available for you to attend during April. Reply to this email with the date(s) that you would like to attend, and we&apos;ll send you further details.

There are only three places for Youth Assessors per date, so allocations will be on a first-come-first-served basis.
