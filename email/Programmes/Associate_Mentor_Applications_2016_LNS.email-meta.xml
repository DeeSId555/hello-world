Dear {!Contact.Name},

We’re looking for reliable and enthusiastic NCS Graduates to come back to NCS this year and volunteer as Associate Mentors! Working alongside our staff, this role is to support this year’s participants to get the most out of NCS.

WHATS IN IT FOR YOU?

- Experience NCS from a different perspective: as part of the staff team;

- Develop skills to enhance your record of achievement / CV / UCAS application;

- Attend specialist training on being a volunteer, youth work, and leadership;

- Receive 1:1 support from one of our NCS managers, who can also be a reference for any future applications you do once you have completed your placement;

- Qualify for the TCS Gold Award!

WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR IN AN ASSOCIATE MENTOR?

- Reliability: Can you commit to at least four days in a row this summer? You can choose exactly when and where this would be!

- Professionalism: Can you be a role model for current NCS particpants, and work as part of our staff team?

- Positivity: Can you use your NCS experiences to motivate others?

Whatever your level of experience, we&apos;ll support you to get the most out of the role. The most important thing is that you are committed!

BEEN AN ASSOCIATE MENTOR BEFORE?

Great! You can apply to be a Senior Associate Mentor using the same application form. This is a chance to come back as a volunteer and further develop your skills - lots of people do this to take them a step closer to joining our paid staff team one day.

WHATS THE TIME COMMITMENT?

All applicants must attend Associate Mentor training: there will be a choice of dates and times, but most will be during May half-term (30th May 2016 - 3rd June 2016)

If successful, your role will last for a minimum of four days during July or August 2016 (details will be confirmed once you have been to training)

READY?

CLICK HERE TO APPLY!

First application round deadline is 22:00 on Sunday 1st of May

Your application form is specific to you, and you can only submit it once.
