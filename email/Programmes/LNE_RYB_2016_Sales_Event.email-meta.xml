    <subject>Exclusive NCS Regional Youth Board Opportunity!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As a member of the NCS Regional Youth Board for North London, we have an exclusive opportunity just for you...

Take part in the National NCS Sales Celebration Event 2016!

We&apos;re looking for 2-3 members to speak at the event and help our NCS Sales team understand exactly what it&apos;s like for a young person taking part on the programme. The details of the event are as follows:

Date: Monday 23rd May
Time: 13:00 - 16:30
Location: Venue in Angel, Islington (exact location confirmed upon application)
Your role: We&apos;ll need you to walk our team through your experience of NCS, leading activities to help staff understand the programme from your perspective as well as how to make sure future NCS participants are fully supported in their journey.

If you are interested in taking part, please contact samuel.hepher@the-challenge.org. As the event takes place on a weekday, we can provide you with a proof of absence letter to give to your school if necessary.

In the meantime, keep an eye out for information on your next NCS Regional Youth Board meeting!

Kind regards,

The Challenge Society</textOnly>
