    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

TCS have some amazing opportunities for you to get involved in this half term! Be a part of our CAT Teams and be funded up to £500 to run your own social action project! Or sign up to be an NCS Changer and have YOUR say on our programme.

CAT Teams:

CAT Teams are social action teams made for you and your fellow grad mates to get creative and run social action projects on an issue that YOU are passionate about; you could be funded up to £500 to run your own project, it&apos;s all down to you! If you want to get involved and run your own social action project, it&apos;s simple! You attend a session, bring your grad mates along, form a team and put forward your ideas on what social action project you would like to run. We will help you come up with a solid plan and on NCS Action Day your team will be pitching your idea to dragons to receive funding.

REMEMBER: The larger your team the greater your chance of receiving more funding.

The first CAT Team meeting will be held on the 19th February 1pm-3pm at The Challenge Waterloo Office.
Address: Elizabeth House, Mezz Floor, 39 York Road, SE1 7NQ

Order you ticket here!
