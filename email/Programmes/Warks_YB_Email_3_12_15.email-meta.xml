    <subject>CORRECTED Next Youth Board Meeting</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

The next youth board meeting is taking place on Monday 7th January from 5.30-7.30pm. If you can&apos;t make it for 5.30, that&apos;s no problem just turn up when you can. I will be at the venue from about 5pm.

This session is a super important one as we are starting our planning for The Big Sleepout taking place in March. We will hopefully be picking the roles in preparation for the event.

Its taking place at the Brunswick Centre, 98-100 Shrubland Street, Leamington Spa, CV31 3BD.

Please let me know if you can&apos;t come. Or if you want to get in touch and ask any questions phone/text me on 07785627463.

Have a great evening and GET EXCITED FOR YOUTH BOARD!
