    <subject>Two fantastic opportunities for NCS graduates!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As an NCS graduate, we&apos;ve got two more fantastic opportunities for you to take part in, so read on to see how you can get involved!
1. Help us select our NCS 2016 staff as a Youth Assessor!

How would you like to be on the other side of an interview, assessing potential summer staff for this year&apos;s NCS programme?

The Challenge Society has an amazing opportunity available to all NCS 2015 graduates! Become a Youth Assessor and help us choose our future Senior Mentors, Programme Leaders, Practitioners, and Community Facilitators. Having your perspective as an NCS graduate who has completed the programme is crucial for selecting the best staff!

Being a Youth Assessor will look great on your CV and personal statements and could help you earn the TCS Silver Award! So help us make NCS 2016 the best year yet, fill out this short application form before Monday 1st February.

If you&apos;re successful, we&apos;ll invite you to Youth Assessor training during the February half-term!

2. Become a member of the Regional Youth Board for North London!

How would you like to be part of the elite Regional Youth Board, being a voice for the thousands of NCS graduates in North London, sharing your views on issues impacting young people across the country?

As part of the Regional Youth Board, you&apos;ll act as the vital link between North London graduates and the National Youth Board, impacting the future of NCS across the country. The Regional Youth Board meets a few times a year, with the first meeting taking place during the February half-term.

There are only a handful of spaces available, so if you feel like you can represent North London across the country, then fill out this application form. If you are already an NCS Leader, well will be in touch with you shortly about being part of the Regional Youth Board.
