    <subject>NCS Associate Mentor application - correct form link!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

On Friday 6th May, we sent you an email to let you know that the application period for the NCS Associate Mentor role this summer had been extended until Sunday 15th May.

Unfortunately, some people had some trouble opening the link to the application form included in that email. If that includes you, please click HERE (http://survey.clicktools.com/app/survey/go.jsp?iv=2bbhwytrbxr8v) in order to access the form. We apologise for any inconvenience.

Kind regards,

NCS Graduates Team
