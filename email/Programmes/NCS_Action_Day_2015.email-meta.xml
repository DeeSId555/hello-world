    <subject>BIG, exciting opportunities starting 7th March</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We have two fantastic opportunities for you below. Fancy a residential programme on a March weekend, or the chance to form part of the Media Team...
My Voice My Vote  Residential

Last Handful of places available on the My Voice My Vote Residential taking place on 7th and 8th March.



We&apos;ll spend time getting to know each other, then we’ll introduce you to the world of digital social action. By the end of the weekend, you’ll have created a Digital Campaign to go online, you’ll have a better understanding of how social action links to Leadership, and you’ll learn a range of really useful skills you can use for campaigning, for University and for the world of work. More importantly, we&apos;ll also make sure there&apos;s plenty of time for you to get to know each other and to meet others who have completed The Challenge from across the West Midlands!

The launch day for the media teams is Saturday 7th March in Birmingham (some exceptions can be made if you can&apos;t attend).

After this three teams will each take on a number of projects in Birmingham, The Black Country and Coventry.

There are a number of roles within the teams including director, editing, filming, sound, interviewers and an Innovative thinker.

It wont take up too much of your time and gives you a chance to experience the NCS programme again this summer...
