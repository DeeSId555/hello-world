    <subject>Final two assessments for Youth Assessors next week - sign up now!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Huge thanks to everyone who&apos;s been a Youth Assessor so far! You&apos;ve done a brilliant job and have contributed to us being able to hire some exceptional staff for NCS this summer.

Our assessments are now sadly coming to an end: we only have two left this year! That means that we&apos;ve already hired a record number of staff.

See below for details, and email Ade at the following address if you&apos;d like to sign up:

adewale.solaru@the-challenge.org


There are only three places for Youth Assessors per date, so allocations will be on a first-come-first-served basis.
