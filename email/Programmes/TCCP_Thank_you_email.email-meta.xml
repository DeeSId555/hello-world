    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for being part of The Challenge this year! Founded in
2009, The Challenge aims to inspire and connect young people to make a difference in their community.  We believe that it is not acceptable that our country has the lowest level of trust and belonging amongst its citizens in Europe. With your help, we have worked to change this by bringing together young people from different backgrounds and challenging them to strengthen their communities.

Thank you, in particular, for partnering with our Challengers this year! Through using their talents to work with the members of your organization, they have learned how to respond to their community’s needs in ways that are both practical and relevant. 

This year has been a great year, but we know there is so much more to do if we are to make a permanent difference to levels of trust in our society.  Over the next twelve months you will see us expand our work to reach twice as many young people. We would love you to continue to be a part of this.

Thank you once again for the difference you have made in the lives of our Challengers!

Yours sincerely,

Craig Morley, Chief Executive on behalf of The Challenge Team</textOnly>
