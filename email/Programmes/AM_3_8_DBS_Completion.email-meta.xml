    <subject>Associate Mentor application: complete your DBS check!</subject>
    <textOnly>FINISH YOUR DBS APPLICATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We&apos;ve noticed that you started your DBS application, but that it hasn&apos;t yet been completed. Make sure you get this done as soon as possible so that you can still be an Associate Mentor this year!



Submitting your documents:

Once you&apos;ve completed the online application, make sure you take your documents to your local Post Office. If you&apos;re unsure of which documents you need or how to get them, contact your local Graduate team for advice.



What if my DBS doesn&apos;t come through in time?

Unfortunately you won&apos;t be able to be an Associate Mentor with us this summer. Make sure you speak to your local Graduate team if this happens.

Need to get in touch with us?

Send an email to your local Graduate Team. Make sure that you include your name, and either the borough that you completed NCS in or your postcode.



We&apos;re happy to help with anything that you&apos;re stuck on with your DBS application, so please do make sure to get in touch if you need anything!
All the best,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
Graduate Team
