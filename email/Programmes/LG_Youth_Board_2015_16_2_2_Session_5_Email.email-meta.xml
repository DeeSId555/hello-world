    <subject>LG Youth Board meeting tomorrow!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello LG Youth Board!


I hope you have had a great start to the week and that you are excited for the pizza and youth board meeting tomorrow!


As I mentioned in my email last week, the meeting tomorrow will start at 5pm and finish at 7pm. I can now confirm that the meeting will be at The Challenge head offices at Waterloo (1 minute walk from Waterloo station). The address is;

The Challenge
Elizabeth House
Mezzanine Floor
39 York Road
London
SE1 7NQ


Next week and for future meetings, we will meet more locally at the New Eltham Methodist Church Hall (I will send the address and more info about this soon).


For tomorrow, I will come and collect you from the main reception on the ground floor at 5pm and bring you up to the room where the youth board meeting will be held.


If you are having any trouble finding the office, or are running late for any reason, give me a call on 07584 232 766.


I look forward to meeting you all and hearing about your plans for your social action event so far!


See you tomorrow!
