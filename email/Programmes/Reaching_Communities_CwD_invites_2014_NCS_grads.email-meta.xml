    <subject>Receiving your &apos;The Challenge with Distinction&apos; award</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations once again for taking part in the Reaching Communities programme with The Challenge Society this summer!

As mentioned during the programme, if you attended every session of the programme, you are eligible to receive the prestigious &apos;The Challenge with Distinction&apos; award. This is awarded to NCS graduates who show ongoing commitment to making a positive impact in their communities.

If you did not attend every session, don&apos;t worry! You can still receive the award by making up the hours you missed through other volunteering. Below is a list of participant names from the programme, followed by the number of hours they will need to make up to receive the award.

If you have hours to make up, you have until Sunday 13th December to complete them. However, if you have no hours to make up, or if you are able to complete them by Sunday 22nd November, you will be invited to attend a graduation ceremony to collect your certificate on Wednesday 25th November, 8pm at a venue in Mile End. If you do not complete your hours by this point, or are unable to attend the ceremony, your certificate will be posted to you at a later date. If you would like to attend the ceremony and are eligible, please reply to this email by Sunday 22nd November and you will be sent further details.

To confirm your volunteering, the person who supervises it will need to email confirmation of the hours you have done. You cannot use volunteering done before you started the Reaching Communities programme on Saturday 8th August.
