Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Here are a few IMPORTANT updates regarding your application to be an Associate Mentor role this summer.

1) Final Job Placement Allocation
Thank you to all of you who attended one of the Associate Mentor Assessments over the past few weeks. It was lovely meeting you and I hope you are excited to start your role over the summer period. We will be allocating all roles over the next 2 weeks and you will receive an email with the dates/times/venue for your placement and the name and contact details of your manager.

2) Back Up Training - Please reserve you space!
We have organised a range of back-up assessment events for those of you who submitted a late application or couldn&apos;t attend a previous session. To reserve a space on your desired date please click here and sign up via Eventbrite.


3) If your going to be 18 or over by the end of August...
You will need to have a Disclosure and Barring Service Check (DBS). These could take up to 12 weeks to process so get yours started now! Click here for information and next steps!

If you have any questions do get in touch with Rhiannon on rhiannon.downer@the-challenge.org or call 07876836445.
