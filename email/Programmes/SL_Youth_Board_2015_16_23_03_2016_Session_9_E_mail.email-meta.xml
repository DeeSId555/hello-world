    <subject>Final youth board meeting - Wednesday 23rd March 5pm</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Youth boarders,

First of all - a big congratulations  for everyone involved in the T-Day event. I truly believe that all of your hard work and resourcefulness made the day a success, and one of the most well attended events in all of South London.

Our final youth board meeting will be on Wednesday 23nd March at 5pm at the Waterloo Action Centre (Mezzanine Level) . We&apos;ll be wrapping things up for the year by getting your feedbank on NCS, the youth board as well as giving you the opportunity for you to give advice to the next youth board team in 2016. They&apos;ll be some pizza (again!) and a free NCS Action day t-shirts for everyone involved.

Please remember to bring any photos from T-Day along with you and receipts for anything you bought.

Look forward to seeing you all then,

Matt</textOnly>
