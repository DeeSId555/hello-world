    <textOnly>Hi LG Youth Board!


I hope you are having a great week and you&apos;re excited about your Half Term break.

Firstly...


*DRUM ROLL*


O2 Think Big have awarded LG youth board with Â£300 for Witness the Fitness! Well done team! A huge shout out to Paige.B, Ndabane and Perri!



Next Tuesday&apos;s youth board meeting will be at The New Eltham Methodist Church again (see my last email for the address), and will be from 1pm-3pm as requested. Please try to make attending a priority, as we have a lot to get through next week!

This Saturday coming marks 3 weeks until Witness the Fitness. I know you can smash it if we make the most of the next 3 weeks!


UPDATES/ACTIONS FOR NEXT WEEK:


- Finance team! Now that you have successfully gained funding for the project - start researching prices of the sport equipment needed/flyers/any other items and put together a draft budget for Tuesday.

- A big well done to the partnership team Abi and Tako for getting in touch with local sports charities  - fingers crossed that you hear back from them soon! Jack also knows some local sports clubs where he does coaching, so maybe work together to get them involved? If you need to forward them onto me at all; Hannah Grace Weston (Assistant Programme Manager - Greenwich) 07584 232 766 / hannahgrace.weston@the-challenge.org.

- I am going to get in touch with Well London http://www.welllondon.org.uk/ for you, as I have a contact there - I&apos;ll update you on Tuesday.

- Ndabane - well done for your work on the logo, it looks great! If you could bring the final version on Tuesday, so Niquella and the Marketing team can create the flyer for the event in the meeting. We need the final promo materials by Friday 19th Feb, so we can promote Witness the Fitness for you on The Challenge and NCS&apos;s social media!

- Niquella - awesome job with creating the social media pages and Eventbrite! Can you share them with me and I&apos;ll try and get NCS to promote them for you.

- Remember to all get in contact with your head of year, so you can  promote Witness the Fitness in your assemblies and get permission to flyer at your schools.

- Perri - well done for getting in touch with Thomas Tallis for our back up location. Give them my details if you need someone from The Challenge to verify the event etc.

- Divine - awesome work on the logistics of the location in the park. Can yourself, Sven and Evangeline make a start on the sheet I gave you to fill in? We can finish it on Tuesday at the meeting.


Lastly, well done for presenting your idea to the Bexley/Bromley (BB) youth board! Everyone was really impressed with how much you have all achieved in under two weeks. Keep up the great work!
