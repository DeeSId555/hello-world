    <subject>Work experience at The Challenge this Summer!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Fancy joining The Challenge team?

This summer, The Challenge is offering week-long work experience placements at our North London office. The opportunity is open to NCS 2014 graduates who have completed at least 16 hours of engagement with The Challenge Society. That includes you!

Successful applicants will have the opportunity to join The Challenge during our exciting period delivering NCS this summer. Having taken part in NCS last year, you&apos;ll have the chance to see behind the scenes and play a part in organising and delivering the programme to over 5000 young people in North and East London! This could range from making sure participants are ready for their NCS experience, organising staff to carry out the programme, or putting the final touches to how the programme will run.

How to apply:

If you are interested, please send a cover letter explaining why you would like to take part and a CV to samuel.hepher@the-challenge.org by 11pm on Sunday 10th May. Please also indicate in your cover letter which of the following weeks you would be available to take part:

- Monday 1st June - Friday 5th June
- Monday 22nd June - Friday 26th June
- Tuesday 28th July - Monday 3rd July (not including Saturday 1st and Sunday 2nd  August)

Assessment:

Candidates who pass the CV stage of application will then be invited to a two-hour group assessment on a weekday evening towards the end of May.

We look forward to receiving your application!
