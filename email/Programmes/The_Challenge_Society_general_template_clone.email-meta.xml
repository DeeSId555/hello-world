    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

We have a great Challenge Action day planned in Croydon on the 26th of November. Come produce some Street Art with a renowned graffiti artist, learn Circus Skills and Drama Techniques &amp; try your hand at Guerilla Gardening. 

It will also be a great chance to meet with other people that completed the Challenge last year and you may not have seen for a while.

There will be even more information appearing on the new Challenge Society website and on facebook shortly.

Would be great to see as many of you there as possible

Hope your keeping well

Andy Luton
