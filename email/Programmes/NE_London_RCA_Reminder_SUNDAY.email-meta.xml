    <subject>Enfield NCS this weekend: What you need to know!</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName}
Don&apos;t forget that this weekend you and your NCS team will be taking to the streets to make your social action project come to life! Over the weekends of September, you will be preparing your campaign materials, running your campaign, raising money for your social action project, and volunteering to make it happen!

What you need to know:
- Be at your venue (same as last week) ready to start at 9:30am sharp!
- Full teams get 20 bonus points towards the Nando&apos;s Challenge!
- Remember your sponsorship money - the front runners are already on Â£150 - can you beat them and do amazing things for your charity partner?
- Bring Oyster cards, lunch and wear comfortable clothes &amp; shoes (especially those doing the sponsored walk!)

Be sure to send your best photos to the wave manager and share on Twitter @ChallengeEast with your wave &amp; team name, to see them on the graduate website!

Visit www.tcs.northeastlondon.orgfor your wave photos and a sneak peak into what&apos;s on offer once NCS is over!
