    <subject>Welcome to Youth Board</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on being selected for Youth Board!

We are currently working out the details of your youth board induction, a chance for you to meet the other NCS Graduates who will make up the Youth Board.

Youth Board induction will be on Saturday 7th November. More details, including time and location will be sent out in a few weeks.

Hope you are as excited as we are about the exciting year ahead. In case you are interested click the link below to see a video of an event that last years youth board ran.
