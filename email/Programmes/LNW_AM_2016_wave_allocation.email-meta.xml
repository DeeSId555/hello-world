    <textOnly>CONGRATULATIONS ON SUCCESSFULLY BECOMING AN NCS ASSOCIATE MENTOR THIS SUMMER! TIME TO CHOSE YOUR WAVES...
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Wave allocations: Well done for successfully making it through the application, assessment and training to become an NCS Associate Mentor this summer!

You can now chose the waves you want to volunteer on!

CLICK HERE TO CHOOSE YOUR WAVES

Click on the link above, read the instructions and choose the borough and dates that work best for you.

Placements will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, and you must choose your wave at least two weeks prior to starting it. That means that if you&apos;d like to work on Wave 1 (beginning Friday 1st July), you must sign up immediately!

The sooner you choose your wave (even if you don&apos;t want to work until August), the more chance you have of securing your place. Once we have seen that you&apos;ve signed up to a wave, we&apos;ll pass you on to your new manager who will confirm your placment and let you know any extra details you need.

Emails to ignore: We have organised a range of back-up assessment events for those that were not able to make the initial assessment. You do not need to attend another assessment so please just ignore these emails!

If you&apos;re going to be 18 during your AM placement: You will need to have a Disclosure and Barring Service Check (DBS). These could take up to 12 weeks to process so get yours started now! Click here for more information and next steps.



If you have any queries about this process, please email tcs.northlondon@the-challenge.org.

We look forward to seeing you in the summer!
All the best
