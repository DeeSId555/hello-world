Did you know that 34% of the homeless population are people under the age of 24 years?

Or that 80,000 young people experience homelessness every year, often through no fault of their own.



Homelessness means not having a place to stay. That may mean sleeping outside, or even sleeping on a friendâ€™s sofa.



On Saturday 11th April 2015, a group of approximately 60 young people will be volunteering to sleep rough for a night at the Black Country Museum.

This is to raise awareness for homelessness in the Black Country and the services that support people who are affected.



Tickets are FREE but entry is a dontation to a local food bank, however big or small.
