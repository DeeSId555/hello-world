<![CDATA[Hi LG Youth Board!<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I hope you are all excited for Witness the Fitness next weekend!!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>We have a lot to do from now until then if we are going to pull this off, so let's really pull together now and make sure the event is the best it can possibly be! I know you can do it and I am really impressed with how much you have achieved in so little time, so let's sprint through these next 9 days together!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Firstly, next Tuesday's LG YB meeting will be slightly different, as we have a lot to achieve. We decided at this week's meeting that we will be meeting <b>outside Marks and Spencer on Bromley High Street at 4pm</b>. This is so we can buy everything for the event together. Don't worry if you can't make it for 4pm, just <u>make sure you are there!</u></div><div><br></div><div>If you need to meet us a bit later, then call me on 07584 232 766 and I will let you know where we are. We will then go to Bromley Central Library and finish up any remaining tasks and talk over the plan of action for the 5th. <u>Please make this meeting a priority.</u> You will need to take the equipment home ready for the event, so if only a few of you come along, then those individuals will have to carry all the equipment home, which I think we can agree, won't be very fair on them.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>ACTIONS FOR NEXT WEEK:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>- JACK: </b>Change all the logos/cover photos etc on all social media from WTF to Indies logo ASAP. I don't think your event will be taken seriously with WTF plastered all over the media pages!</div><div><br></div><div><b>- NIQUELLA</b> - Activate the card by following the instructions on the letter to obtain the PIN number. Order flyers from Vistaprint to be delivered by Monday, so you can bring them to Tuesday's meeting. If you aren't going to be at the meeting, then order them to someone else's address who will be coming to the meeting and also make sure you have given the card and PIN number to someone who will be there. I reckon you will need several hundred flyers. Enough to hand out at each of your schools PLUS loads for the day. 300 perhaps?</div><div><br></div><div><b>-</b> <b>EVANGELINE &amp; DIVINE</b> - Update team on plan of action so far on Whatsapp. Finish looking up equipment needed for the event and send list of anything that needs purchasing now online to Niquella to order. Also think about how you will brief the team/partners on the day.</div><div><br></div><div>- <b>ABI</b> - Update me (phone or email) and the team on any partner involvement by Monday morning E.g. who? what are they doing? I need this info to include it in the risk assessment for the event. They cannot be involved without it being risk assessed first. Also contact Evangeline and Divine for the information to brief the partners ready for the day. Give any partners my details as the staff point of contact.</div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>- EVERYONE: </b>Promote the event social media page on Facebook and the Eventbrite page&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">online! They currently don't have much of a following. Collect flyers at next Tuesday's meeting and hand out at your schools. Check in on the Whatsapp group for tasks you can help the team with.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I know you guys can do this :) Let's pull this together LG!
