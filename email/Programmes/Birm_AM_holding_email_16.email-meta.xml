    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

You may have been expecting an email inviting you apply to be an Associate Mentor with NCS this summer by now.

DON&apos;T WORRY! We haven&apos;t forgotten you, a slight technical problem means that you will get your invitation email next week. It will contain more info about being an Associate Mentor and how to sign up.

Stay excited,
