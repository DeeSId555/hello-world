    <subject>Challenge Action Teams: Get your £500 funding!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for signing up to be in our CAT Teams! Challenge Action Teams are a great way for you to benefit your communities by forming your own social action projects and being funded up to £500 to run them!

What are CAT Teams?

CAT Teams (Challenge Action Teams) are social action teams made up of you and your fellow grad friends. It&apos;s a chance for you to get creative and run social action projects of an issue or topic that YOU are passionate about; you could be funded up to £500 to run your own project, it&apos;s all down to you!

How does it work?

If you want to get involved and run your own social action project, it&apos;s simple! You will be attending a session where you can bring your grad friends along to form teams and discuss and put forward your ideas on what social action project you would like to run. Once you have come up with a solid plan for your social action project, you and your team will be pitching your idea to dragons on NCS Action Day in order to receive your funding, where you can then run your project! You can have up to ten people on your CAT team, so bring any of your fellow grads that would like to get involved to expand your team in order to receive more funding.

When?

The first CAT Team meeting will be held on the 19th February 1pm-3pm at The Challenge Waterloo Office, where you will be coming up with your own social action project plan. Please feel free to come with any ideas or thoughts on what sort of project you would like to run.

Address: Elizabeth House, Mezz Floor, 39 York Road, SE1 7NQ

Looking forward to seeing you there!</textOnly>
