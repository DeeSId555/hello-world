    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Remember that your Youth Assessor training is taking place tomorrow from 6-8pm at The Challenge, 52 Charlotte Street, Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham, B3 1AR.

Please check out how to get here on Google Maps. and arrive at 5.50pm.

There will be pizza! We still have a handful of spaces left, so if you have a friend who did NCS, and is under 18, feel free to bring them along.

Please let me know if you can&apos;t make it now and we can see if there is space on the back-up training next Monday.

Thanks,

Liam
