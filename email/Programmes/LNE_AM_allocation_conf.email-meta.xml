    <textOnly>NCS Associate Mentor wave confirmations

Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

We have now confirmed the allocation of NCS Associate Mentors to waves this summer. You can find which wave(s) you have been allocated to by clicking HERE. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tzV9k8P1e52lVI4Kd9Oti3a3j-j_cpi6w1v7mavZi5U/edit?usp=sharing

Please note the following points:

Applicants have been allocated to a maximum of TWO NCS waves. This means that you may not have been allocated to all of the waves you signed up for.
If you cannot find your name anywhere on the sheet, but you have previously filled it in, please reply to this email with your name and desired wave(s).
If you can no longer attend the wave you have been allocated to, please reply to this email to let us know.
Seven days before your start date on your wave, you will receive an email with further information about locations, times and contacts.
After that, you will receive a call from your Assistant Programme Manager who will answer any questions you have ahead of your placement.

Remember, if you&apos;re going to be 18 before the end of August:

You will need to have a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. These can take several weeks to process so if you haven&apos;t started the application yet, click here and get going!
If you have already started your application but not yet completed it, make sure you finish it as soon as possible!
If you already completed your application, well done!
Once you have received your DBS certificate, you will need to scan it and email it to samuel.hepher@the-challenge.org. You will then need to bring the original copy to your first day on the programme.

See you soon!
