    <subject>10K 100 Challenges Sponsorship Event! - THIS WEEKEND!!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Lovely NCS with The Challenge Young People, 
Another week has flown by! Here at BANT HQ we are all really excited about your 100 Challenges Sponsorship Challenges this weekend! 
Some boring bits and pieces not to forget ;)
•	Address: Forest Gate Youth Zone,  1 Woodford Road, Forest Gate, E7 0DH
•	Please arrive promptly at 9:30am 
•	Bring a packed lunch and water bottle to stay hydrated
•	Wear a pair of comfy shoes! 
•	Check the weather and dress appropriately 
•	Fancy dress is encouraged, come on onesies are the fashionable attire (staff too!)
•	Remember to bring any sponsorship money that you have collected
Most importantly, please remember that the main aim of the sponsored walk is to raise money and raise awareness for the charity that you met in the summer. Remember you are not doing this for yourself, but for the local charity that needs your support and generosity to continue making a positive impact through the work they do. You will only get out what you put into the walk.
“Be the change you want to see in the world” - Mahatma Gandhi
Big Ups
We have only had one Real Challenge Action Weekend so far and already everyone deserves a big up for being super! Here are a few people who’ve stood out last weekend! 
To our social media managers, especially Nasima, Matthew and Laurice who tweeted the most over the volunteering days! See Debbie to be rewarded your prize. 
Apart from that bring your enthusiasm and energy this weekend - we can’t wait to see you all again! 
From the BANT B Team!</textOnly>
