    <subject>VlogStar Challenge Competition Deadline - Submit your VLOGS!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},
I hope you are well. First off thanks so much for being involved in the VlogStar Challenge workshops over half term - it was so impressive to see what you produced in such a short amount of time!

Here is a quick reminder to submit your videos to the competition by this Sunday 13th of March!

How?
1. Finish off your 2 - 3 minute vlog on a topic of your choice but around the theme of INSPIRATION....

2. Upload your finished video to YouTube and set as Unlisted. Send the link to the video form using this application form.

SIMPLE!

Remember you can only submit 2 vlogs to the #VlogStar Challenge but you can start filling your channel with lots of great content - YouTube might be watching!


As a reminder here is what you could win....

- 150 Regional finalists will get a place on a workshop at Youtube HQ where you can continue developing your Youtube challenge with support from the experts;

- 15 Regional winners will get time at YouTube state of the art production space;

- The VlogStar champion will be annonced at a grand final event in June where you could win up to Â£500 worth of equipment, 1-2-1 mentoring from YouTube experts and use of their production space!!

Good luck!!
