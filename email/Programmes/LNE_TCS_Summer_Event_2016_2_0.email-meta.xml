We&apos;re releasing information on some of the charities coming to help you launch your careers...

Does international development sound exciting to you?

How about mental health?

Or perhaps you want to know how to work with refugees?

Our helpful charities will be there to guide you!
Here are the values of some of our mystery charities:

&quot;WE PROVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN&quot;

&quot;We wonâ€™t give up until everyone experiencing a mental health problem gets both support and respect&quot;
