    <textOnly>Hello, Changemakers!

Thank you so much to those of you who took part in our first Changemakers session back in December.

Your ideas for how you would engage a community you care about for National Voter Registration Drive (NVRD) from February 1st - 7th were amazing. At the end of the session, you were called to action to:

a) Register to vote: see here for more information about registering to vote, and here to register
b) Make your NVRD ideas come to life and help us make history this February

The next #TeamNVRD meet-ups are next week - can&apos;t wait to see you all again! We&apos;ll be bringing all of you together to plan, discuss, and supporting each others&apos; ideas. You have a choice of two days and locations, to make it easier for you to attend - click the relevant link below to get your free Eventbrite ticket (make sure you only sign up to one!):

Thursday 14th January in Waterloo (Elizabeth House, 39 York Road, London, SE1 &amp;NQ)
Friday 15th January in Kentish Town (Highgate Studios, 53-79 Highgate Road, London, NW5 1TL)

If you can&apos;t attend either, please email graduates@the-challenge.org.

Bite the Ballot and The Challenge are going to make history this February. We invite you to be there.
