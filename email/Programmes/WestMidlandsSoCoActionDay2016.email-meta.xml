    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName}

It’s your NCS Youth Board here!


You know how cold your hands get when you leave the house without those warm, furry gloves, or when you’re chilled to the bone because you’ve forgotten a jumper? Well, imagine what it’s like to be that cold, all the time?


This is the daily reality for hundreds of thousands of people and families in the UK but also closer to home, in your local community of Coventry.


Because of this, NCS&apos; Coventry youthboard have decided to organise a Big Sleepout, to put our empathy to the test by trying to experience what being homeless is like for a whole night.


The event will be at the AT7 Centre, on Friday 4th March from 7PM-7AM.


The event itself will consists of interactive games and inspirational stories about people who have experienced being homeless in an attempt to challenge peoples perception about homelessness and we will be collecting food donations to help support a local food bank provide emergency packs to those in need in the community of Coventry.



If you want to make a difference make it now.

Reunite with your NCS friends over a fantastic cause.


This is the link below, register for your free ticket and join us on the 4th March.

You will be safe and supervised by staff from the National Citizen Service - Once you have signed up - NCS will contact you and your parents with a consent form about the event




Looking forward to seeing you all there!</textOnly>
