    <subject>Upcoming Events from The Challenge Society</subject>
    <textOnly>To Challenge Society Grads,

Here are two upcoming events, organised by your fellow grads:

Event 1

Do you want another excellent opportunity to reunite with those you completed the challenge with? Do you like listening to inspiring live music, watching exotic cultural dances and acts and eating FREE food? Of course you do and as it just so happens the NERF challenge youth board 2014 have just the event for you!

On the 15th of March, UNITE will be coming to the Forest Gate Youth Zone (Postcode E7 0DH) from 2pm -5:30pm. Mashing together a great variety of culturally diverse performances and a motivational speaker, UNITE aims to increase social cohesion in Waltham Forest, Redbridge, Newham and Enfield. This event is totally unique so it is something you do not want to miss!

Please RSVP by responding to this email or joining our Facebook event. Also, feel free to invite friends who did not complete the challenge. See you there!
