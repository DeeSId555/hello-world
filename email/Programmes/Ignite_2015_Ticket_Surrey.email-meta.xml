Christmas Present Appeal

This Saturday we are partnering with Epsom and Ewell Foodbank. They work incredibly hard to support families in need and this year we want to help them ensure every child gets a gift this Christmas.

If possible please do bring along a small present to give to a child this Christmas. This could be anything from a book, teddy bear to a boardgame. Please do remember to put the age and gender the present is for on the wrapping paper!

Competition Time!

Win an Ipad Mini!

We want to give every NCS graduate the opportunity to be involved in Ignite - but we need your help! We need you to get online, into your school, back in touch with your wave and telling everyone about why they should also come down to Ignite!

The person who gets the most NCS graduates to sign up and attend on the day will win an IPad Mini! Winner!
