    <subject>NCS Youth Board meeting coming up - Wednesday 27th January</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Youth Boarders,

Your event on Saturday 5th of March is approaching quickly, and we have a lot of work to do to make sure it&apos;s a success!

We&apos;ll be meeting on Wednesday 27th January at The Waterloo Action Centre (back hall) at 5pm. Make sure you be on time!

Everyone should have been split into teams, so make sure to bring everything you have to the next meeting. Just to recap

Logistics team:
Should have secured a venue for the 5th of March. Please bring details of this so the other teams know what to work with.

Finance team:
Funding should have been applied for and/or a fundraising plan should be brought - ready to put into action in the next week.

Marketing team:
The logo, tagline and social media pages should be set up and ready to go.

I&apos;ll be helping you to design what the event will look like on the day and supporting you with making sure it&apos;s well attended as well! Look forward to seeing you on Wednesday with plenty of ideas!
