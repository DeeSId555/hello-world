Help out at one of our incredible volunteering projects during the day and get guaranteed you entry to our afternoon of workshops (from Sport Relief, Bite the Ballot, St John&apos;s Ambulance, and loads more) as well as our AFTER PARTY!

If you don&apos;t have time to volunteer then don&apos;t worry: you can still come along to the workshops and party by paying Â£3 here or on the door. Anyone who came to an NCS graduate event during half term also gets in free!

Get to us for 4pm for guaranteed entry, doors close at 5pm.
Volunteering projects are taking place all over London, so check out the sign-up form and website to find one near you.

The workshops and party are at Conway Hall, 25 Red Lion Square, London, WC1R 4RL. You can claim back travel expenses by bringing your receipt with you.

Any questions, email us at tcs.northlondon@the-challenge.org.

See you there!
