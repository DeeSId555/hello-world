Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Here are a few IMPORTANT updates regarding your application to be an Associate Mentor role this summer.

1) Final Job Placement Allocation
Thank you for attending AM training last week! It was lovely meeting you and I hope you are excited to start your role over the summer period.
To sign up to a wave please click
HERE
We will be allocating all roles over the next 2 weeks and you will receive an email with the dates/times/venue for your placement and the name and contact details of your manager. Please note that not every area will be running waves 1-12 so please do pick a variety of locations and dates you will like to work on so we can find a wave for you!

2) More emails coming.. sorry!
We have organised a range of back-up assessment events for those that were not able to make the initial assessment. THERE IS NO NEED for you to attend another assessment so please just ignore these emails!  for those of you who submitted a late application or couldn&apos;t attend a previous session.

3) If your going to be 18 or over by the end of August...
You will need to have a Disclosure and Barring Service Check (DBS). These could take up to 12 weeks to process so get yours started now! Click HERE to find out more information and next steps!

If you have any questions do get in touch with Ola at ola.awosika@the-challenge.org or call 07785623395.
