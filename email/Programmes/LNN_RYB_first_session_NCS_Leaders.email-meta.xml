    <subject>Correction: First Regional Youth Board Meeting Date</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

In our previous email inviting you to take part in the Regional Youth Board, we wrote the wrong day of the week for the first session. Whoops! Sorry about that! To clarify: the session is taking place on Tuesday 16th February.

You will need to go to the Eventbrite page to register for your free ticket, in order to confirm your attendance.

Date: Tuesday 16th February
Time: 14:30 - 17:30
Location: Courtyard 2, Highgate Studios, 53-79 Highgate Road, London, NW5 1TL
Tickets: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/north-london-regional-youth-board-first-meeting-tickets-21256360346

At this first meeting, you&apos;ll have the opportunity to meet your fellow Regional Youth Board members, learn about goings on on the National Youth Board, give your views on how NCS will look in 2016, and prepare to take part in NCS Action Day on Saturday 5th March!

If you are not able to attend the meeting, but would still like to remain part of the Regional Youth Board for future meetings, please let us know by replying to this email.

We look forward to seeing you there!
