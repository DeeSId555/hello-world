    <subject>Youth Board Launch Sat 7th November</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

The Warwickshire youth board launch is finally here and you are part of it! We have a great year planned designed for you to get loads out of it and have a great time.

It all starts Saturday 7th November at 12.45pm.

Where? Holiday Inn, Olympus Avenue, Tachbrook Park, Leamington Spa, CV34 6RJ

What do we do? We introduce you to your fellow youth boarders. We get to know each other and you find out what is going on in the year ahead. Then we finish the afternoon with a game of bowling.

When and where does it finish? We expect to finish about 4.15pm over the road at the Ten Pin Bowling.

Do I need to bring anything? No, you don&apos;t need to bring anything but yourself.


If you are coming please email me or text me (include your name) and let me know by Sunday 1st November at the latest. If you want to take part in youth board but can&apos;t come to the launch, just message me and let me know.

I will give you a call next week to introduce myself and check the details with you. My details are:
