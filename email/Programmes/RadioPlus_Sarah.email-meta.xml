    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Radio Plus 101.5FM, a community radio station in Coventry are offering NCS graduates an opportunity to gain 5 days work experience at their radio station.

They are looking for people with an interest in media who are confident communicators. 

You need to be available from Monday 29th August - 2nd September, 10am - 4pm every day.

You will be working on a community survey for Radio Plus across Coventry, which is a really important piece of work for Radio Plus to help them to move forward with their plans to expand and to be able to demonstrate to their advertisers that their audience size is growing.
 
During your week you will receive full training, gain an insight into the running of a radio station, and information about routes to employment; as well as a Radio Plus t-shirt and prizes.
 
Radio Plus can be found at the following location:
