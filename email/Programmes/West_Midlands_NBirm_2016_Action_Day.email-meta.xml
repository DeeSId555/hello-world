    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

NCS Grads! Join us at The Big Sleepout, we hope you are all really excited! The are a few things we need to run past you before the event on Friday 4th March;

The event will be held at The Coffin Works B3 1JP, from 7pm-7am the following morning -  this means you will be sleeping out all night

Things you need to bring with you; a torch, wear some warm clothes, a sheet of cardboard and bring a sleeping bag - the idea is for you to understand what it is like to be homeless and experience sleeping rough for one night along with other NCS graduates.

Your entry ticket to the event is through bringing a copy of your eventbrite e-ticket and a donation for a local food bank. Please find the eventbrite link below, tickets are based on a first come first serve basis. The deadline for sign up is 12pm on Wednesday 24th February

Imagine...you have just returned home one evening after a fun day out with friends to find that you need to leave the place where you are living due to circumstances beyond your control. You have less than one hour to throw your clothes, textbooks, important documents, special photographs -- in other words, the contents of your life -- into suitcases and duffel bags, you are unsure if you will be able to return, and worried about leaving anything irreplaceable behind.

Once you have signed up on eventbrite, you and your parents will be sent a consent form, and contact will be made with your parents to gather more information. The deadline for consent forms to be sent back to us is Sunday 28th February.

Thankyou
The North Birmingham Youth Board</textOnly>
