    <textOnly>An exclusive opportunity for YOU from The Challenge…




Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


We hope you&apos;ve been having an amazing time on NCS, and that you&apos;ve had a great Showcase today. As you have taken part on NCS you are eligible to apply for HeadStart - a new programme The Challenge has developed in partnership with the Mayor of London to give you the skills and experience to get ahead.

The HeadStart programme is made up of three simple steps:

Volunteer for at least 16 hours before December. You can choose from lots of great volunteering opportunities on the HeadStart website (we will then match you up and arrange for your first day of volunteering), or you can decide to find your own volunteering opportunity.

Engage in exclusive skills workshops, developed with leading employers to give you the right skills and aptitude to get ahead, including expert communications coaching and interview preparation sessions.

Get a guaranteed interview for a paid part-time/seasonal job with New Look, Starbucks or Lloyd’s Banking Group, or an exclusive paid internship with the Mayor of London’s office or Zendesk.



Here is Emmanuella - a recent HeadStart graduate - to tell you about her HeadStart experience.


HeadStart will help you:

Gain skills and experience

Be more employable

Stand out on your UCAS form

Meet new people and get back together with friends from NCS 2015!


CLICK HERE TO REGISTER YOUR INTEREST

Applications will open in September when you will be emailed your unique login info for the HeadStart website where you will get to choose your volunteering opportunity and desired interview.

Any questions? Email the HeadStart team, check out our website or get in touch on facebook.

We look forward to receiving your application!
