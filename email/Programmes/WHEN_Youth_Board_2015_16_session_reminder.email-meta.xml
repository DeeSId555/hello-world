    <textOnly>Hello all,

I am back and ready to hear about all the work the Youth Board has been doing whist I was away!
The next meeting will be on Tuesday 1st March, 5 - 7pm at 639 Enterprises Center, 639 High Rd, N17 8AA.

Please reply to me with your name and &apos;Yes&apos; if you are attending or &apos;No&apos; if not, by 2pm on Friday 26th February.

Some important information that we have received about the event:

Timings: The event will have to take place from 11am till 4pm.
Resources: Resources will have to be bought on the day however there might be an opportunity to buy some resources in advance.
Budget: You have a budget of £260 however I have heard that you have applied for O2 Think Big funding of £450 and it has been successful which is amazing. This will give you a total budget of £710 which is a lot of money. I am so proud of you all.
Promotion: Keep promoting the event so that lots of people attend.


See you soon!
