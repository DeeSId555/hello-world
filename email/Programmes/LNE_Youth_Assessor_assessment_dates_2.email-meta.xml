If you would like to sign up to an assessment, click HERE (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iuffjN6UU73HCOpA5XdJvsTkmgxAdU02osP2W3FfUHI/edit?usp=sharing) and add your name to the assessments you would like to attend. Please make sure you read the guidance in the top right-hand corner of the sheet before filling it in.

REMEMBER - At training, you may have added your name to a paper sheet of assessment dates. Unfortunately, the times of certain assessments have since changed, so please disregard any assessments you chose. Allocation of assessments will be based solely on the sheet in the link above, and we will contact you with confirmed details of your allocations once you have filled it in.

We can&apos;t wait to see you at assessments!

Kind regards,
