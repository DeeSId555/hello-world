    <subject>NCS Associate Mentor application - correct form link!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

On Friday 6th May, we sent you an email to let you know that, as a 2014 NCS Graduate, you are now able to apply to volunteer as an NCS Associate Mentor this summer.

Unfortunately, some people had some trouble opening the link to the application form included in that email. If that includes you, please click HERE ((http://survey.clicktools.com/app/survey/go.jsp?iv=2bbhwytrbxr8v) ) in order to access the form. We apologise for any inconvenience. The deadline for applications remains Sunday 15th May.

Kind regards,

NCS Graduates Team
