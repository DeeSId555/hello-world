    <subject>Post NCS: Take 2 Programme</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you have enjoyed your NCS experience so far!

We are launching a new programme called Take 2. It is the chance for up to two people from each team to link up with NCS participants from other waves. It all starts with a residential THIS WEEKEND on Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th November. There are action hub meetings every two weeks until your team deliver your event in March next year. You will be working with our best local partners to develop your leadership, teamwork and event planning skills.

The programme is free and we provide transport to the residential. The coach will be leaving from Walsall on Saturday morning and returning on Sunday afternoon.

There has been a lot of interest in Take 2 and we only have a few spaces. It is first come first serve. To sign up email me at liam.roseblade@the-challenge.org to tell me that you want a place or text/phone me on the number below. Why not get a few of your NCS friends to do it at the same time?

Here is a video about Take 2

If you have any questions please contact email me or drop me a text on 07785627463.

We look forward to hearing from you. Hope you are as excited to get involved again as we are!
