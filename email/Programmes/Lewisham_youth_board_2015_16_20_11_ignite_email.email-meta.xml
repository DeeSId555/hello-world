    <textOnly>Dear NCS Grad Rep,

I hope you had a great summer on The NCS Programme and have some great memories. So as you were successfully elected as a grad rep I am calling on you to give some help with our exciting event that takes place next Saturday 28th November. You should have received an email about this.

We need you to be there to represent your wave so I do hope that you have already signed up for your ticket. In addition to this I have a job for you. Please could you contact as many people from your wave as possible and get them to sign up so that we can get tickets out as soon as possible.

There will be many opportunities for you to find out more about the world of work and university as well as a networking lunch to meet people from a wide range of professions. They will be able to offer advice around how to go about getting into the career you want as well as sharing personal experiences with you.

This is a really worthwhile and fantastic opportunity so please sign yourself up to come and please contact as many people from your wave and ask them to sign up too.
Oh and very importantly tell your wave that when they do sign up to say on the form that you told them about it and if you get the most people signed you will win an ipad mini.

See you next Saturday 28th November!!

Regards
