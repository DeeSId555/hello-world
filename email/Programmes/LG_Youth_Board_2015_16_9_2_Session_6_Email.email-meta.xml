    <subject>LG Youth Board meeting tomorrow!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi LG Youth Board!



Firstly, a big well done for your great work at last Tuesday&apos;s meeting and thank you for coming all the way to The Challenge offices. You all made a lot of progress during the two hours and Witness the Fitness is looking to be a great event for your local community and NCS grads!


As mentioned last week, the meetings from now on will be more local at the NEW ELTHAM METHODIST CHURCH
Address; 435-439 Footscray Road, New Eltham, London, SE9 3UL.
The church is under a 5 minute walk from New Eltham station and is easy to get to from both Greenwich and Lewisham.


LG Youth Board meetings will also be weekly on Tuesdays (5-7pm) from now until the event on Saturday 5th March. Try to make it to as many meetings as possible and update the team on the Whatsapp group with any progress with your individual tasks, if you aren&apos;t able to make a meeting.


See attached the timeline you created on Tuesday&apos;s meeting of the tasks that need to be completed leading up to the event. Logistics team - you may want to add to this and edit it each week to reflect the team&apos;s progress.

I have also outlined which team each LG youth board member is on the timeline below E.g. Finance, Logistics, Partner Relations or Marketing. Don&apos;t worry if you weren&apos;t at the last meeting - just come along and we can add you to a group and catch you up.


See you tomorrow! I&apos;ll bring the snacks and someone will need to chair the meeting (I&apos;ll type up an agenda for the chair/s to follow).
