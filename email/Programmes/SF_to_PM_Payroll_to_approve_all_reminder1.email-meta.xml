    <textOnly>Hi,

If you haven&apos;t done it already, please approve all payroll for your RAMs and  LOs as soon as possible.  Evolution will process payments this coming Monday.

Please go to your views in Job Applications to approve their payroll. Click on the link below to get to the Job Applications home page:
For LOs, Rams and Practitioners go to the view  &quot;Payroll approvals Summer-long roles {!Wave__c.Wave_Cluster__c}&quot;.


Thanks!
