    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for being part of The Challenge this year!  Founded in 2009,
The Challenge aims to inspire and connect young people to make a difference in their community.  We believe that it is not acceptable that our country has the lowest level of trust and belonging amongst its citizens in Europe. With your help, we have worked to change this by bringing together young people from different backgrounds and challenging them to strengthen their communities.

Thank you, in particular, for working with our Challengers to help them discover the positive impact they are able to make in their local areas. By setting a practical challenge and giving them the opportunity to fundraise for your organisation, they have learned not only the importance of community development, but also how to effectively fundraise and partner with organisations to bring their ideas to life. 

This year has been a great year, but we know there is so much more to do if we are to make a permanent difference to levels of trust in our society.  Over the next twelve months you will see us expand our work to reach twice as many young people. We would love you to continue to be a part of this.

Thank you once again for the contribution you have made to the lives of our Challengers!

Yours sincerely,

Craig Morley, Chief Executive on behalf of The Challenge Team</textOnly>
