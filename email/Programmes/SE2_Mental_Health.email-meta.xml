    <textOnly>Hi everyone



You might remember that before you started your exams/coursework etc you expressed an interest in completing a mental health project! Thank you! We can now reveal that this project will be taking place on the 24th and 25th August in Reading!



Day 1 (Wednesday 24th August) 10:30-4pm

You will attend a workshop learning about mental health and how it particularly affects young people. You will learn about different types of mental illness, as well as exploring some of the issues and problems with mental health in the UK. This workshop will be written and delivered by our local Mental Health Advisor. You will then hear a talk from a local mental health charity about some of the issues they face, that could be relevant to your campaign. Following this there will be lunch and a chance to ask questions. After lunch you will decide on your campaign topic and buy resources to make it happen!


Day 2 (Thursday 25th August) 10-3pm

You will meet to prepare your campaign before delivering it in Reading town centre! There will be a celebration event at the end.
