Jo has fed back to me that you guys would love a CV workshop for your final Youth Board meeting. GOOD NEWS - we have organised one!

I have decided to cancel next Tuesday&apos;s LG meeting and instead please all sign up to this fantastic opportunity. See below.


UBM CV &amp; Interview Workshop (www.ubm.com)


UBM IS AN INTERNATIONAL MARKETING AND EVENTS COMPANY WHO CONNECT BUSINESSES TO DIFFERENT AUDIENCES IN MORE THAN 20 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD!


On Thursday 7th April (9.30am - 5.30pm) UBM are offering graduates of the National Citizen Service programme the opportunity to attend their headquarters in South London and be involved in a fantastic workshop. The event will include:

- An introduction from different teams about what they look for when recruiting employees and tips on how to stand out in the application process

- A session on how to create the perfect CV and draft a cover letter â€“ with individual support and guidance from the team
