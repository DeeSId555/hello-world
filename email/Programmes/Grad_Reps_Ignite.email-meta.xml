    <textOnly>Hey Grad Reps,

We hope you all had a great experience on NCS The Challenge! 
Now you are part of TCS, you have the opportunity to get involved in all of our exclusive grad events, and it is up to you to represent your teams and get them involved in what we have in store! We have some amazing event and projects lined up and we need you to inform your teams! 

First of these is Ignite! The Summit! We would like you to get your fellow grads to sign up and attend Ignite! So, its competition time...
As Grad Reps, if you can get 3 or more grads to sign up to Ignite! The Summit, you will be entered into a prize draw to win a Dr Dre Beats Pill Speaker (RED). *With world AIDs day coming up we&apos;ve picked this as a prize because all (RED) products contribute a portion of their profit to the Global Fund to fight AIDs.*

Sign up as many people as you can in your team and you may win this amazing prize! 

Best Wishes,

The Core Grad Team</textOnly>
