City Year is a leading youth and education charity working in London and from 2013 in Birmingham.  We aim to tackle  two of the biggest  social welfare issues in the UK: educational under-attainment in disadvantaged  communities and youth unemployment.  Our goal is to achieve a &apos;double&apos; impact through making a difference in the lives of both our volunteers and the communities they serve.

We are the only coordinated opportunity for full time volunteering within English schools. No other movement for social change offers young people the chance to volunteer full time for a whole year in inner city schools. Have you got what it takes to make a difference?





Who We look For

We look for people that demonstrate these qualities: passion, idealism, energy, commitment, dedication, tirelessness, optimism, hope, selflessness, pride, leadership, focus, ambition.
