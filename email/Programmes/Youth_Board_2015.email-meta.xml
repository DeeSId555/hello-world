Welcome to Youth Board!

Firstly, a huge thank you to those who attended our first meeting last night. We definitely got an insight into what you want out of the Ignite event!

For those who couldn&apos;t attend, fear not there is one more meeting before Ignite, and that will be your last chance to get involved for this particular event.

PLEASE NOTE THE DATE HAS NOW CHANGED TO:

Evening meeting:
Wednesday 18th November 2015
5pm - 6:30pm
To finalise your workshop plan and to go over the rota for the day to ensure you all get to participate in the event.

This session will be held at our North London office:

Unit 2, The Courtyard (follow &quot;Valet Parking&quot; sign)
53-79 Highgate Studios,
