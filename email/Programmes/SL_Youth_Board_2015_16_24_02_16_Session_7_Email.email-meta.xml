    <subject>NCS Youth Board meeting coming up - Wednesday 24th Feb</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Youth Boarders,

We only have 12 days left before your event on Saturday March 5th, so now is the time to put the pressure on, start increasing the marketing campaign and generate some interest in T-Day.

I&apos;m still getting final confirmation on whether we can use the Prince of Wales as a venue, but I&apos;m confident we can make this happen. I&apos;ll give you the final answer on Wednesday.

Now is the time to start ramping up the marketing campaign and try to get as many signs up as possible, as well as confirmed performers. We have the funding from Starbucks - and we&apos;re still figuring out the logistics of this, but hopefully I&apos;ll be able to get this to you this week.

Our next meeting will be at 5pm at The Waterloo Action Centre on Wednesday 24th Feb. Look forward to seeing you all there, ready to get to work!
