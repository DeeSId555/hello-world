    <subject>NCS Regional Youth Board - have your say!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As a member of the NCS Regional Youth Board for North London, we&apos;d love to hear your opinion on a range of issues relating to the boards.

We&apos;d really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to fill in this short survey (https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/RYBFeedback), and let us know what you think. This will help us make the Regional Youth Boards as rewarding and effective as possible in the future.

Thanks very much, and look out for an email soon with the date of your next Regional Youth Board meeting!

Kind regards,

The Challenge Society</textOnly>
