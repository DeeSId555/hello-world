    <subject>Share your NCS graduate experience with Minister for Civil Society and industry leaders!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As an NCS graduate who attended one of our employability workshops with Lloyds Banking Group and Business in the Community (BITC), we have an amazing opportunity for you!

BITC helped us organise the workshops through their Business Connectors scheme, and now they&apos;re looking for one young person to speak to a group of high profile figures about their experience at the sessions.

You&apos;ll need to be comfortable speaking for a couple of minutes in front of people like Rob Wilson MP (Minister for Civil Society) and executives from companies including John Lewis, Fujitsu, Lloyds Banking Group and Carillion.

It&apos;s an amazing opportunity to meet some highly influential people in the world of business and government, and take part in some high profile networking. You will be accompanied by a member of staff from The Challenge.

The event details are as follows:

Date: Wednesday 27th April
Time: 09:30 - 11:30
Location: Bethnal Green (exact venue TBC)

There is only ONE space for an NCS graduate to speak, so if you are interested, please fill out this short application form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QohlBL1o0pQyD515qoJNwcAJN2rvpK0xXEsZxqQ4PrA/viewform) by 09:00 on Thursday 21st April. If you are successful, we will be in touch to confirm details.

As the event is taking place during a school day, The Challenge Society can provide a letter of proof for your school to excuse your absence.

Kind regards,

The Challenge Society
