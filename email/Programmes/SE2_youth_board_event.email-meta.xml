    <textOnly>Hi guys!



Just a final reminder for the event on Saturday! Thanks so much again for signing up!



Here is the Eventbrite link! If you could arrive for 13:30 that would be great.



The afternoon will involve talking to our guests, playing games, getting to know the older people of Reading and eating some afternoon tea!



See you there!
