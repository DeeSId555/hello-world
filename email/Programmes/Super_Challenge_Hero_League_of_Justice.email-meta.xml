 NEWSFLASH! Count Foxula&apos;s Minion spotted carrying strange device.

Today an unnamed source has reported to The Super Challenge Hero League of Justice that they believe the Evil Count Foxula is concocting an evil plan to enslave the whole of Bury town. &quot;It&apos;s &apos;orrible! I&apos;m so scared. Those pointy ears and fluffy tail... so frightening. Who knows what that Foxula is planning next, all I know is I want no part in it!&quot; The brave young man managed to snap a quick photo of one Foxula&apos;s evil minions carrying a strange metal device, the purpose of which has yet to be determined.

&lt;Picture here&gt;

&quot;I saw the lil blighter carry the strange metal box into the Brookshaw Centre on Brookshaw Street. He was muttering something about the plan all coming together on the 11th of April and that the Super Challenge League of Justice would never stop Count Foxula! Then I ran away. I didn&apos;t want the minion to see me, who know what he would&apos;ve done!&quot;

Super Danny Challenge Man, leader of the Super Challenge League of Justice was unavailable for comment, but Count Foxula called in to inform us that &quot;Nothing is happening on the 11th of April, certainly not the total enslavement of Bury followed by World Domination.&quot; and that Challengers are advised &quot;Not to help the stupid Super Challenge League of Justice because they are stupid-heads.&quot; We attempted to hang up on him but before we could he stated &quot;Do not be tempted by The Challenges offer of  delicious free food, for though it is no doubt delicious and free it is much better to stay home and await your enslavement.&quot;
