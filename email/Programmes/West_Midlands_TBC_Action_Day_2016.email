This means you will be sleeping outside overnight.<br><br></font></li><li>You will gain entry to the event <b>only</b> by bringing your Eventbrite e-ticket along as well as <b>either</b> a food donation <b>or</b> sponsorship money that you have collected to complete the Sleepout. All donations will be given to a local organisation that supports the homeless in the Black Country.<br><br></li><li>What do you need to bring with you?<br>Warm clothes, a sleeping bag,&nbsp;a torch&nbsp;and a sheet of cardboard are the&nbsp;basic requirements needed.</li></ul><ul><li>Tickets are available on a first come first serve basis and the deadline to sign up is <b style="text-decoration: underline;">12pm on Wednesday 24th February.</b><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br>You can sign up here:&nbsp;<br><br></span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-big-sleepout-black-country-tickets-21354245122" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-big-sleepout-black-country-tickets-21354245122</a></div><br><br></li></ul><div>Once you have signed up on Eventbrite, we will be in touch to confirm your place and provide you with the location of the Sleepout.
