    <subject>Amazing opportunity for NCS Ambassadors and graduates from Hackney, Newham &amp; Tower Hamlets!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We have a fantastic opportunity for NCS Ambassadors and NCS graduates from Tower Hamlets to take part in Rich Mix&apos;s Youth Takeover Festival 2016!

Rich Mix is a theatre and arts centre in Shoreditch, and over the upcoming February half-term, it will be hosting five days of live music, theatre, spoken word gigs and artist talks, as well as workshops, debates and networking opportunities with industry professionals and like-minded people. And as an NCS graduate, you can get involved for FREE!

The Challenge Society is looking for a group of NCS graduates made up of trained NCS Ambassadors and graduates from Tower Hamlets to come along with us to the &apos;Rich Mix x #IITSPIRATION Connects&apos; event on the first day of the festival, Monday 15th February, from 15:30 - 18:00.

At the event, you&apos;ll get the chance to meet loads of other young people and industry professionals from creative and arts organisations in the capital, take part in group sessions, workshops and networking, and share your amazing experience of NCS to inspire other young people to take part!

Attending will also help you towards earning The Challenge Society Bronze, Silver and Gold awards!

If you are interested in being part of our select group, then fill in this form by the end of Sunday 7th February, and we&apos;ll be in touch if you are selected!

Don&apos;t miss out!

All the best,

The Challenge Society</textOnly>
