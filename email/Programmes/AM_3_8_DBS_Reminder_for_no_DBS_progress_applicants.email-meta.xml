    <textOnly>REMINDER: DBS CHECK REQUIRED
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations again on successfully applying to be part of our Associate Mentor team on NCS this summer.

We sent an email last month to let you know that you will need to complete a DBS check. It doesn&apos;t look like you&apos;ve done this yet.

Here is the information you need:

What is DBS?

(DBS stands for: Disclosure and Barring Service)



A DBS certificate is a check that is done to look at someoneâ€™s criminal record, to ascertain how suitable they are to work with different groups of vulnerable people (including children, young people and some adults)



Do I really need a DBS check?

YES.



Every Associate Mentor and Senior Associate Mentor who will be over the age of 18 when they work with us this summer needs to have a DBS check.



How much does it cost?

It is completely free for you.



How do I apply for a DBS check?

There are two things you need to do:



1) Complete an online application

2) Take some ID documents along to a Post Office



1: The Online Application


Click here to go to our DBS provider, GB Group
(https://gbg.onlinedisclosures.co.uk)

Click REGISTER

You need to provide an organisation PIN &amp; secret word. These are:

- Organisation PIN: 140118
- Secret Word: Z4LQX

YOU MUST APPLY USING THE SAME EMAIL ADDRESS THAT THIS EMAIL WAS SENT TO
otherwise we will not be able to match your DBS to your records.

2: The Documents



You will need to take some documents to be checked at a local Post Office


You will be told what documents you need when you apply
Not all post offices can check the documents.
- you can ask at your nearest Post Office whether they offer &quot;DBS Verification Service&quot;
- or click here for a full list of Post Offices you can use


You can click here for a full guide on the DBS process.


It can take several weeks for a DBS to returned, so it is very important you complete the process as soon as possible.

All the best,
NCS Graduates Team
