    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for applying to be a youth assessor. Great news, your application was successful. You are going to learn all about what companies look for in assessments and what makes a good staff member for NCS.

The venue is The Challenge, 52 Charlotte Street, Jewellery Quarter, B3 1AR. (Check out Google Maps for the best way to get here).

You have two choices for when to do your Assessor training before you start assessing staff. Please click the following link to pick which one you would prefer:

If you need help paying for transport or received transport support during the NCS programme please let me know so I can help!

We will provide some food and drink during the evening (maybe pizza!). Any questions please get in touch.

Have a great evening,
