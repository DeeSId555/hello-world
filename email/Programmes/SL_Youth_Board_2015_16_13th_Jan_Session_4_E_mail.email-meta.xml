    <subject>NCS Youth Board Meeting - Wednesday 13th January 5pm</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Youth Boarders,

Happy new year to you and I hope you&apos;ll all rested from the holidays!

Our next youth board meeting will take place at 5pm on Wednesday 13th January at the Waterloo Action Centre (SE1 7AA).

Remember, we only have 7 weeks before you run your event so it&apos;s important to attend and contribute as much as you can before then!

Last meeting we divided into teams, Marketing, Logistics, Finance and our Leaders. Depending on your team, you will have been given tasks over the holidays.

Finance: Search for source of funding/develop a fundraising plan. Please bring this to the next meeting.

Logistics: Search for venues. Please bring at least 5 venues you can use with a price estimate for each to the meeting

Marketing: Develop a catchy name/tagline for the event focussing on tolerance.

Leaders: Keep the group on track and make sure everyone brings something to the next session.

This next meeting we will create a timeline for what we need to do for each date and also make a list of resources we all need to bring for the day.

Good luck and see you all on Wednesday!
