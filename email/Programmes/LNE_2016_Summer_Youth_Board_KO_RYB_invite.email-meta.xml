ONE LAST THING:

On Monday 1st August, we&apos;re holding our annual TCS Summer Kick Off near Walthamstow (you should have received an email about it on July 6th).

We&apos;re looking for members of the Regional Youth Board to sit on a panel of Dragons to give funding to charity projects devised by your fellow NCS Graduates.

If you&apos;re free on the day, and would like to be an all-powerful Dragon, reply to this email to let us know. We&apos;ll then discuss it further at the meeting on July 23rd.

We can&apos;t wait to see you again this summer!
