Since you graduated in October your elected Youth Board have been working hard to plan an event for you and your community. So in the February half term your Youth Board invites you to &apos;Challenge&apos; the stereotypes. 
 
We will be bringing together the old and young for an afternoon tea party, with food, live music, quizzes and dancing. This is an awesome chance to show the local community what the youth of today is REALLY like! 
 
Along with other Challenge graduates you&apos;ll be helping to set up the party first - balloons, bunting the works! - then from 2-4pm you&apos;ll be enjoying the tea party with the older guests. Next you&apos;ll get to spend some quality time with each other catching up on what you&apos;ve been doing since the Challenge and thinking about how you can continue to have fun like you did in the summer.
 
 So are you up to the Challenge?.

The Details of where to be when are...
When: Wednesday 15th February
Time: 12.30 - 5.30pm
Where: St Peter&apos;s Centre, Charles Street, Hillfields, Coventry, CV1 5NP
You can also bring any friends along with you who might like to come (between the age of 14 &amp; 19).
