We&apos;re sorry it’s been a while since we’ve been in touch. How’s it going? We hope you have been working and playing hard. For those who have upcoming exams we wish you the best of luck! There are some exciting opportunities coming up and we thought you might be interested in getting involved. 

Do you remember being an Associate Mentor last summer? In the next couple of weeks we will be sending you an invitation to apply to become a Senior Associate Mentor this year. If you are successful this is a great role to develop your key skills and is one step away from becoming a Team Mentor in 2013 which is a paid summer role with The Challenge. We’ve changed the role to ensure you can build on what you learnt last year and give you new tasks to do.

In the meantime a good friend of ours told us about an exciting challenge to go abroad and make a real difference. Get the chance to have an experience similar to the Real Challenge in another country. We think it’s an awesome opportunity. 

Do you want to volunteer overseas to make a difference to the lives of some of the world&apos;s poorest people? Then Raleigh International Citizen Service (ICS) could be for you. Raleigh ICS is a community volunteering experience in India and Nicaragua open to UK citizens aged 18 or over. You will spend ten weeks on projects addressing healthcare, education and livelihood generation. Each project is designed to bring about lasting change and as an ICS volunteer you can contribute directly to this change.

Placements will begin in June/July 2012, October 2012 and February 2013. Following their overseas placement, volunteers will then take part in UK community action. There are only have 36 placements available for volunteers for end of June and July. Visit http://www.raleighinternational.org/what-we-do/raleigh-ics to find out more.

Happy April!</textOnly>
