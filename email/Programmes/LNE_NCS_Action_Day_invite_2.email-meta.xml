    <subject>NCS Action Day 2016 - It&apos;s nearly here!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

Have you heard? Saturday 5th March is NCS Action Day 2016!

It will be a day to reunite with your NCS friends, help out with social action projects near you, discover amazing opportunities and celebrate all your achievements!

Here&apos;s how it&apos;s going to go down...
Daytime - make a difference!

Between 11:00 - 16:00, there will be a variety of social action projects taking place around London, led by your local Youth Boards, that you can get involved in.

Taking part in a project will earn you a FREE ticket to the social action celebration and reunion event later in the day!

To find a project near you, click HERE and sign up.



Evening - celebrate!

From 16:00 - 20:30, we&apos;re taking over Conway Hall in Holborn, central London, for our Celebration! Here, you&apos;ll be able to take part in interactive workshops and stalls with amazing organisations such as ICS, Sport Relief, Bite the Ballot and loads more.

Then there&apos;ll be live music, a DJ and prizes, so you can relax and enjoy all the great things you&apos;ve achieved as an NCS graduate!

If you are not able to take part in a project during the day to get a free ticket to the evening event, you can purchase a ticket for Â£3.00 HERE, with all proceeds going to charity.

If you attended an event run by The Challenge Society during February half-term, you have already earned your free ticket and can pick it up at the venue on the day.
It&apos;s going to be a fantastic day, so sign up now to make sure you don&apos;t miss out!

See you soon!
