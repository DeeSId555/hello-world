    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for being one of our Dragons this year!  Founded in 2009, The
Challenge aims to inspire and connect young people to make a difference in their community.  We believe that it is not acceptable that our country has the lowest level of trust and belonging amongst its citizens in Europe.  With your help, we have worked to change this by bringing together young people from different backgrounds and challenging them to strengthen their communities.  Particularly, as a member of the panel of Dragons, your feedback on their ideas and plans has helped the teams to demonstrate the skills they learned throughout the Challenge programme in ways that are both practical and meaningful. 

This year has been a great year, but we know that there is so much more to do if we are to make a permanent difference to levels of trust in our society.  Over the next twelve months you will see us expand our work to reach twice as many young people. We could love you to continue to be part of this. 

Thank you once again for the contribution you have made to the lives of our Challengers! 

Yours sincerely,

Craig Morley, Chief Executive on behalf of The Challenge Team</textOnly>
