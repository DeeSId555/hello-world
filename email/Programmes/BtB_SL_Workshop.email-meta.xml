    <subject>Join Bite the Ballot in Parliament and have YOUR say!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName}





Did your education prepare you to take part in politics? Bite the Ballot have an opportunity for you to have your political say!



Bite The Ballot is looking for 30 young people (16-24) to share their views and opinions about our education system. You will be discussing things such as:


Is the education system fit for purpose?
Does it prepare you to take part in politics?
And if not, what needs to change - and why?




The aim is take your ideas about political education directly to decision-makers - but they need your help!



Bite the Ballot is running a workshop in Parliament on Wednesday 20th January from 10:30am to 11:30am in the Macmillian Room (Portcullis House) for you to express YOUR views and opinions on the education system.



As this session will be held during school hours, if you wish to attend and need clarification from your school or teacher, TCS will be happy to write a letter which will confirm details and information about the event.



So, if you want to get involved and have your say all you need to do is register your interest here and Bite the Ballot will be in touch!
