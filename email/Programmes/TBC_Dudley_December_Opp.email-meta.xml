    <textOnly>Hello,

We have a couple of wonderful volunteering opportunities happening in Dudley during December that we&apos;d like to share with you:

Black Country Food Bank are looking for around 12 volunteers to help with a bag pack and a collection at Sainsbury&apos;s Amblecote, Sandringham Way, Brierley Hill, DY5 3JR. It will run from 11am - 1pm on Saturday 20th December and will involve helping pack shopping at the tills, telling people about the Foodbank and collecting money.

Black Country Foodbank helps vulnerable individuals and families in crisis through the provision of 3 days emergency food supplies while a longer-term solution is developed. The services provided have an enormous impact on the people who use them giving them an important breathing space at a time of great need.

If you are interested in this opportunity please contact Jen Coleman at Black Country Food Bank, email: jen.coleman@blackcountryfoodbank.org.uk  tel: 01384 671250.

Sycamore Adventure have two volunteering opportunities at Merry Hill Centre, Brierley Hill, West Midlands, DY5 1QX during December.

Gift Wrapping For Sycamore - Volunteers are needed to wrap presents in exchange for donations for Sycamore Adventure. There will be two carts opposite the entrance to Eat Central. Merry Hill will provide a staff member on every day and volunteers are there to support them. You can do it alone or with a friend, and for the whole time or just for an hour or two!

The times are as follows:

Sat 20th: 11-12:30pm  12:30-6pm
Sun 21st: 12-4pm
Mon 22nd: 12-3pm  3-6pm 6-9pm (1 pair on each shift would be appreciated)
Tues 23rd: 12-3pm  3-6pm 6-9pm (1 pair on each shift would be appreciated)
Wed 24th (Christmas Eve): 10-4pm

Bag pack for Sycamore - Volunteers are also needed for a bag pack in Merry Hill, Sainsbury&apos;s on Tuesday 23rd December. They expect it to be really busy and are looking for 8 people on each of the two shifts 10am-1pm and 1-4pm. Again, you can do it alone or with a friend, and for the whole time or just for an hour or two! Every little helps!

If you can spare a few hours out of your Christmas Shopping and are interested in helping Sycamore with either of these opportunities please contact Lorraine on 07766684495.

Thank You,

The Black Country Team</textOnly>
