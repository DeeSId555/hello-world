    <subject>Final Youth Board meeting before your event!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi all,

Everyone had a really productive time in the last session, and we got a lot done in preparation for T-day on Saturday 5th March.

We have a couple of important things to complete before the next meeting:

Getting people to sign up: The link to the eventbrite page should be sent around the Whatsapp group. It&apos;s important to get people to come, but importantly - to sign up online so we know how many people are coming!
Buying equipment: This is the final weekend before the event, so it&apos;s a good time to buy anything that you need. There is some remaining budget, so talk to Richard, Steven and Aisha in the finance team - and remember to keep receipts for everything you buy!
Confirming acts: This is important. Especially to know what time performers are coming and what they need.
NCS Action Day celebration: Everyone involved in making T-Day possible will get exclusive access to the post-event celebration, starting from 4pm in Holborn. If you haven&apos;t got your ticket, I&apos;ll give it to you in the next meeting.

The next youth board meeting will be at 5:30pm in The Challenge Office (Elizabeth House, York Road, SE1 7NQ) on Wednesday 2nd March. There may be a special food selection as well, as a reward for your work...

Look forward to seeing you all then,
