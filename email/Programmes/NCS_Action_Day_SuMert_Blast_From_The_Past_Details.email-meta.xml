    <textOnly>Hey Grads,

Thanks for signing up to to volunteer at Ryelands Care Home in Sutton! This email will let you know all the details for the day and what you need to bring.

Being part of #BlastFromThePast, you will be helping in a local care home and spend the day engaging with residents and taking part in a range of activities which they love to do but are in need of a bit of assistance. This can include teaching them about new technology, helping them write a letter to a relative, or even playing some games. You will also be making a creative mural for a keep sake for the care home in the afternoon, along with putting together some flower poses for the residents to receive.

Being involved in this social action project means you have earned free tickets for the NCS Action Day celebration event taking place in Conway Hall after your project from 4pm to 8pm! You will be travelling from the care home to Conway Hall with your mentor.

This project will take place between 11am - 3pm. Please arrive at Ryelands Care Home for 10:45am so everyone is ready for 11am.

Address: 15 Beddington Gardens, Wallington, Greater London SM6 0JF

Please make sure to bring an oyster and a packed lunch as there are no shops nearby to buy food. Please also bring some money to put on your Oyster card as you will be getting the train to Holborn where the celebration event will take place.

You will have 2 mentors on the day.
