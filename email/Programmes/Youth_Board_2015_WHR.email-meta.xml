    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Last year you completed NCS with The Challenge and you were chosen by your wave to represent them at Youth Board. It is now time for Youth Board to begin, our first meeting will be at 6pm on Wednesday 14th January.

At the first meeting you will be getting to know each other, working out what you want to gain from the experience, start planning how your meetings will be structured (to make sure you get the most out of them) and what you will be doing for the rest of the year. You are the representatives for NCS Programme 2014, you will plan events, have a chance to volunteer on 2015 NCS programme, learn marketing skills and choose workshops to learn the skills that YOU want. Remember it is YOUR youth board!!

The location is Frenford Youth Centre, address below;

The Jack Carter Centre

The Drive

There&apos;ll be free pizza, fun, games and the chance to meet your new team and think about what you want youth board to be. Call 07587031853 for more information.

See you there!

Sarah
