    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

All current members of the Youth Board should have received a text on Monday about the Youth Board meeting TOMORROW (Thursday 7th January) from 6pm - 8pm at the Kenhill Bar, Theatre Royal Stratford, E15 1BN. So far, only half of the members have confirmed their attendance or given their apologies for not being able to attend.

If you have not replied to the text, or if you have not received it, please do get in touch with me via email or phone - my contact number is 07785615033. If we have not heard from you by the meeting tomorrow, your place on the Youth Board may be offered up to people who are able to commit to the meetings. If this is something you want to chat through, please give me a call!

I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible tomorrow!

Thanks,
