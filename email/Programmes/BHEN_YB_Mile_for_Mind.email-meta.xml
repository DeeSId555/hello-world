    <subject>Fun Run event organised by your NCS Youth Board this Saturday</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

During the summer you voted in your Youth Board reps for the year. They have been working extremely hard over this revision period to organise a Fun Run event this Easter.

The event is in aid of Mind in Haringey and Mind in Enfield, who provide mental health support in their local area.

Please come down for fun and fundraising! This is a great chance to see people you did NCS with last summer. It is a family event so we would like to invite your family too.

What: A Mile for Mind. Come and get involved in running a mile either by yourself or run sections of it as a team- or just come and support.

When: Saturday 4th April, 12-3pm

Where: Millennium Green
Station Road
New Southgate
N11 1QJ

Find more info on Facebook: www.facebook.com/amileformind or contact your Youth Board rep.

We hope to see you there,

Your BHEN Youth Board (Barnet, Haringey &amp; Enfield)
 
  
The Challenge is a major provider of NCS (National Citizen Service)
