    <textOnly>{!Contact.Name} HAVE YOU REGISTERED TO VOTE?

Dear {!Contact.Name},

With the EU Referendum fastly approaching, you should make sure you have your say and register to vote today!


Click here to register to vote now!

Why should you register?

- Even if you&apos;re not old enough to vote yet, simply being on the register does so much for you!

-  Just being on the register means politicians can&apos;t ignore you or fellow young people when making decisions about your country.

- So if you&apos;re passionate about politics, want to have your say in society and know if you&apos;re in or out, then register to vote today!
