    <subject>Become a Changemaker with Bite The Ballot!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

Remember learning about the power of your political voice during the Bite The Ballot session on NCS?


Well now The Challenge Society is working in partnership with Bite The Ballot (BTB) to offer 10 NCS graduates from North East London the opportunity to become an accredited Changemaker.

What does it involve?

Changemakers will participate in three main activities between February and May 2016:

Participation: Help BTB with their National Voter Registration Drive in early February.
Online and Offline Social Action: Bring your local communities together to talk about the big issues.
Accountability and Decision Making: Organise and take part in your local &apos;Leaders Live&apos; event, getting the chance to question and hold to account the people who make the big decisions where you live.

Why should I take part?

You&apos;ll become an accredited Changemaker, with the opportunity to train future generations of young people on everything you&apos;ve learned.

You&apos;ll learn loads of new skills, including campaign planning, effective social media, political advocacy, fundraising, and so many more!

You&apos;ll get VIP access to a range of future opportunities with BTB, including travel, international training and employment.

How do I apply?

Fill in this form and we&apos;ll be in touch if you&apos;re successful. The deadline for applying is 16:00 on Friday 11th December.
