    <subject>A big well done and invitation!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey guys,


It was great to see you on Saturday, I hope you had a well deserved rest on Sunday! Myself and Alice were so impressed with your performance at Action Day and all your hard work that you put into Witness the Fitness despite the weather!

We are holding a South East London Partner Networking event next week on Wednesday 16th March 3 - 5pm at The Waterloo Action Centre. We would love for you to be involved if you are available.

The purpose of the afternoon is to launch the summer 2016 NCS programme and for our business, charity &amp; partner organisations from the South East London zone to network with each other.

We are going to have various activities going on and are inviting NCS Graduates to represent the programme, run various activities and to network with our partners.

There are various roles and responsibilities on the day you can do including:

- Signing in/meet &amp; greet partners
- Running team icebreakers/energisers
- Sharing &apos;your journey of NCS&apos;
We feel that you would all be excellent candidates to attend!

Transport will be covered, refreshments provided and if you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Could you please let myself or Lisa (lisa.wilson@the-challenge.org) 07587037609 know by this Friday 11th March if you are interested and able to attend?


Thanks!


Hannah


P.s. Next Youth Board meeting is next week Tuesday 15th March 5-7pm. I will send a reminder text on Monday!</textOnly>
