    <subject>NCS Associate Mentor application - important extra information</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your application to be an NCS Associate Mentor this summer.

As you will be turning 18 during July or August, you will need to apply for a DBS certificate before you can carry out the role. To find out more about the process, and to begin your application, please click here - https://staffing.the-challenge.org/assets/2016DBSinstructionsAMs.pdf.

Once you have received the certificate, you&apos;ll need to scan it and send a copy to us, and then bring the original along when you start your volunteering.

If you have any questions, do get in touch.

Kind regards,

The Challenge Society</textOnly>
