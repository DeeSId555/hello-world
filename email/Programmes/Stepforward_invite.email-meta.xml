    <subject>Opportunity to inspire and work with some amazing young people!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


I wanted to let you know about an opportunity that might be of interest.


In September we will launch our first Step Forward programme. This programme gives school leavers from all backgrounds their first experience of the workplace.

We’ve had over 1000 applicants for the programme and have selected 50 highly motivated and engaged young people. Currently we are looking for organisations that might be interested in employing one or more of these apprentices.
Thanks to government funding, they are available for a whole year at a cost of just £9,154 to employers, which makes this a great opportunity to get an extra person in your team at a very reasonable price (while also doing some real good).

We’re planning to take eight ourselves as it’s such a good deal!

Please click the logo for more information and do get in touch if you are interested. We will get someone from the Step Forward team to give you a ring or alternatively you could contact jeyanti.yorke@the-challenge.org.

Kind regards,

Barney Harker</textOnly>
