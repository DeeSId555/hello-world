    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Happy New Year from the TCS Team! Because you signed up for one of our opportunities and are considered an Active Grad, we have another exciting opportunity for you to get involved in below! But first, Grad Rep training!

As you expressed your interest in volunteering alongside our Programmes Team as a Grad Rep, training will take place on Wednesday 27th January from 5:30pm to 7:30pm at Wandsworth Training and Resource Centre. Get your ticket HERE!

Address: Alma Road
London
SW18 1AQ

What the job entails:

Grad Reps
will be working alongside Programmes to help change the face of NCS, helping make our programme more youth led. You
will also be the first port of call when Youth Boards, The NCS Trust (cabinet office) or The
Challenge are promoting an opportunity or looking for feedback and are responsible for sharing these opportunities with your team!

Being a Grad Rep also comes with lots of benefits which include helping you build on many skills such as:

Communication
Teamwork
Organisation
Interpersonal skills

A job role like this will also receive great recognition from universities and future employers, so it will look great on your CV and personal statement! If you would like any more information about this job role please find the job description attached.

Want to get involved in another amazing opportunity? Free The Children want you to volunteer at their concert in Wembley Stadium!
