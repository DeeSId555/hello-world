    <subject>Opportunity for young young person with NCS 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

Recently your young person took part in NCS with the Challenge. There is now the opportunity for them to take part in the programme again, guiding the participants of 2015 in a volunteer mentor role.

All the young people recently received an email inviting them to apply for the role. As their parent or guardian we want to make sure you know of the opportunity. As with all our opportunities we would love your young person to take part, offering them any extra support that they would need to get the most from the experience.

The Associate Mentor Role

The Associate Mentors&apos; offer support during the non-residential third week of the programme. In most areas this role lasts for four days. During this week the participants go on a visit to a professional organisation and design a social action project. The role of the Associate Mentor can be adapted to the needs of your young person. It can involve giving guidance to a group of participants based on the previous experience of NCS, or more of a logistical support role.

This role takes place throughout the summer programme with training for the role late May/early June.

Support Available

As with the summer programme we aim to be as inclusive and flexible as possible. Below are just a few of the ways we could ensure that your young person could have a great experience as an Associate Mentor:

Flexible role responsibilities
Shortened days
Travel to and from programme organised and paid for by The Challenge
A support worker for your young person


Next Steps

If this is something that you would like your young person to get involved in please fill in the form below and we will give you a call to discuss the role in more detail and the support needs of your young person to help them get the most out of it.

Thanks,
