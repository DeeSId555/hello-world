What are we looking for in an Associate Mentor?

Professionalism: Can you be a role model for current NCS participants, and work as part of our staff team?
Positivity: Can you use your NCS experiences to motivate others?

Been an Associate Mentor before?

Great! You can apply to be a Senior Associate Mentor using the same application form. This is a chance to come back as a volunteer and further develop your skills - lots of people do this to take them a step closer to joining our paid staff team one day.

If successful, your role will last for a minimum of four days during July or August 2016 (details will be confirmed once you have been to training)


Whatever your level of experience, we&apos;ll support you to get the most out of the role. The most important thing is that you are committed!
