    <textOnly>Hi {!Wave__c.APM_first_name_del__c},

As {!Wave__c.Name} has now finished, this is a gentle reminder to approve all expenses for the summer staff. If you have not yet done this, please do so as a matter of priority, as the expenses and payroll will be processed by Evolution tomorrow.

To review your expenses, please go to your views on Expenses: https://na8.salesforce.com/a1P/o



Thanks!

This is a standard email, sent automatically when a wave ends. PMs are copied into this email.</textOnly>
