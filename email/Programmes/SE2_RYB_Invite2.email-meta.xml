Please also let me know if you want to be on the board but cannot make this meeting and we can keep your name on the list! if not we will have to assume you are no longer interested in this position!





Also, you might have noticed that we are running an Easter competition to tell us your NCS story in a creative way. It doesn&apos;t have to take you long at all- write a letter, a poem, draw a picture or make a video to showcase what NCS meant to you and why other young people should do it! You could win a beats pill speaker or over Â£100 in shopping vouchers!



The deadline has been eggs-tended to next Friday (1st April) so please consider completing this google form and entering!
