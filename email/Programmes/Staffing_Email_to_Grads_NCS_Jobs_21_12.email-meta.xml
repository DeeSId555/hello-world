    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

The NCS programme will be the experience of a lifetime for over 42,000 young people in summer 2016, and we want you to be a part of it!  As one of our amazing grads, we’d love to have you back - only this time, you’ll be the one changing lives. Sign up for a seasonal role today!

Be an inspiration!

Nobody knows the impact of NCS like you do, and now it’s your chance to pass that experience on. Gain great experience for your CV, push yourself as a person, and give something back - all at the same time.

We have over 4,500 paid seasonal roles to fill in 2016, and we’d love you to get involved -  check out this video  where last year’s staff share their incredible NCS experiences!

What are the seasonal roles like?

No matter what you’re interested in, we have a perfect role for you. Join us as a Senior Mentor, support your own group of 16 year-olds through the programme, and show our young people a real example of the impact NCS can have.

Alternatively, become a Practitioner and get paid for your passion. Use your skills in photography, media, drama, enterprise, art, music, or sport to inspire your groups to try something new.  Check out our seasonal roles here.

Sounds great - what  next?

The summer programme takes place from late June to late August, and the dates are flexible so that you can work it around any other commitments.

Take a look through our  seasonal roles  and when you’ve found the right one for you, get involved and  make an application.

When signing up to the staffing website please use a different email address to the one you used for your young persons account. This will prevent your account getting lost in our system.

Successful applicants will be invited to one of our group assessments. We&apos;ll start reviewing applications from January.

Questions?

If you have any questions, get in touch with our staffing team on our general helpline: seasonalroles@the-challenge.org. You can also find most information on our  FAQ&apos;s.

We are excited to have you back!

Best Wishes,

The Staffing Team!
