    <textOnly>Hi Guys!



You are receiving this email because you have signed up for one or more of our summer events! it could be our Youth Board Event CommUnity, our Shinfield Drama Project, A Mental Health Awareness project, or other summer initiatives!



I just wanted to say a big thank you for your interest!



Please make sure the dates of your projects are in your diary:-



CommUnity- 23rd July

National Disability Day- 10th July

Shinfield Drama Project- 3rd and 4th September

Mental Health Awareness- TBC but likely to be the 23/24/25 August



Graduate activity is now taking a little rest (I am going on holiday!) and I will be back on the 18th May. You will receive more detailed information about your summer projects and what you need to do after this date!



In the meantime please encourage all of your friends that did NCS to sign up with you! I want this to be the biggest and best summer yet!



Good luck with all the revision or whatever else you might be doing and I will be in touch towards the end of May/beginning of June!
