    <subject>Next Youth Board meeting on Tuesday!!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName}!

Only 2 more Youth Board Meetings until NCS Action Day!

I know we spoke about making the meeting earlier during Half Term however I have an important meeting at 10am which I cannot miss so normal time for the meeting (more sleep yay!).

So our next meeting will be;
Tuesday 16th February at 17:30-19:30

at:

The Cr√®che
Croydon Voluntary Action Centre,
82 London Road
Croydon
CR0 2TB

I have an update about funding and Faith has been a star and created a fantastic flyer/logo which will be advertised on the TCS Website!

Please reply to let me know if you are able/unable to attend (by email or text)! As mentioned there are only 2 more Youth Board meetings before NCS Action Day so I expect everyone to attend this meeting.

See you then!
