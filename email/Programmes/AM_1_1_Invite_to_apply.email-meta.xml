    <textOnly>ASSOCIATE MENTOR

APPLICATIONS OPEN: 7th April 2015 - 8th May 2015
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We’re looking for Graduates of NCS with The Challenge to come back and volunteer as Associate Mentors. Working alongside staff, you will support this year’s participants to get the most out of NCS.

What’s in it for you?

· Experience NCS from a new perspective: you’ll be volunteering as staff - not as a participant

· Develop skills to enhance your record of achievement / CV / UCAS application

· Fast-track your Distinction award

· Get great experience of working with young people alongside professionals

Who are we looking for?

· RELIABLE: Can you commit to at least four days this summer (various dates &amp; locations available)?

· PROFESSIONAL: Can you be a role model &amp; set the tone?

· POSITIVE: Can you share your NCS experiences to motivate others?

Whatever your level of experience, we&apos;ll support you to get the most out of the role. The most important thing is that you are committed.

Been an Associate Mentor before?

Great, you could apply for Senior Associate Mentor. With a little more responsibility, Senior Associate Mentor could take you a step closer to joining our staff team one day.

What is the time commitment?

· All applicants must attend an Assessment Session (between 16 May 2015 - 31 May 2015)

· If successful, your role will last for four days during July or August 2015 (we’ll agree with you when and where you&apos;re working after assessment)



READY?

CLICK HERE TO APPLY
Good luck!
