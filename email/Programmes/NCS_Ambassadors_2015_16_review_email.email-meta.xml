    <subject>NCS Ambassadors 2015/16 - we want your feedback!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you very much for being an NCS Ambassador in 2015/16. This year we&apos;re recruiting over 30,000 young people to take part in NCS 2016 and you&apos;ve played a vital part in helping us achieve that!

In the future, we want to make sure that the NCS Ambassador programme is as successful and impactful as possible, so we&apos;d love it if you could spare a few minutes to fill out this short feedback form - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Sbnh0APzUlSgL1WoFuYyDWfLSbP8lGPoMH90Isk9pfI/viewform

Thank you very much, and in the meantime, keep an eye out for more NCS graduate opportunities with The Challenge Society this summer.

We hope to see you again soon!

The Challenge Society
