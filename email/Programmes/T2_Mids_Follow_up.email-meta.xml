    <subject>Take 2 Programme - Last Few Places Available</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

If you haven&apos;t yet signed up for the Take Two programme, it&apos;s your last chance. There are only a few places left so make sure you get your application in soon.

The link to apply is: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N9N0j39zB4ijNf1TVTtXM8y-Z_5fpeygo8GO7uNc6oM/viewform?usp=send_form

If you don&apos;t take this space up in the next two days it will be offered out to more people and you will lose your opportunity.

If you want a reminder of what Take 2 is about, watch this Youtube vid.

If you have already applied, we will be in touch soon with more info.

Have a great day,
