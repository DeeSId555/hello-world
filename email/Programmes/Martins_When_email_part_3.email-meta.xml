    <textOnly>Dear, {!Contact.FirstName}!

Welcome to your first monthly email which will give you a handy guide for everything you might need in the run up to Summer 2016 with NCS.

These emails will share best practice on how to be a successful NCS partner in 2016, and give you an opportunity to upload your volunteering opportunities and update you on more opportunities your organisation might want to get involved with The Challenge.

The Challenge Society

As well as helping to promote your opportunities to our 6,000+ active NCS graduates across North London, we&apos;re always on the lookout for ways we can collaborate with our fantastic partners year round.

Our aim is to connect our NCS graduates with ongoing experiences that promote social mixing, benefit local communities and provide developmental opportunities for participants.

If you share some or all of the same goals and would like to discuss how we can work together more closely outside of NCS season, then get in touch with our local Graduate Programme Associate Manager, Sam Hepher, on samuel.hepher@the-challenge.org with your ideas.
Best Practice Corner

Best practice corner aims to give you some top tips in order to get the best out of collaborating with us this summer.

We will look at everything from &apos;Engaging with our young people during visits&apos; to &apos;Supporting teams to fundraise for their volunteering days&apos;.
This month we will look at &apos;Engaging with our young people during visits&apos;.

Often going to a new place is a daunting experience, particularly when meeting people that you may not have met before, let alone people who we feel are very different to ourselves. This is no different with our young people, below are 3 things you can do to help our young people really engage with your organisation.

1. Be enthusiastic - positive energy is infectious! The young people really engage with smiling and general happiness, this will really help to set the mood for your visit.

2. Tell the young people about your mission and why its important - young people really want to know why what you do is so important, this will help them to really understand how to get the best out of working with you.

3. Keep an open mind - every team of young people that visit you will be different, and have its own unique character. Find out about what makes them fantastic and use their skills to your advantage.

More top tips coming soon!
NCS - Seasonal staff roles available!

The NCS programme will be the experience of a lifetime for over 42,000 young people in summer 2016 and if you&apos;re 18 you can apply to be a staff member on the programme.


The success of NCS depends heavily on our seasonal staff members, who work with our young people to motivate, lead and inspire them. As the programme grows, so does the number of seasonal staff required.



This year we have 4,500 seasonal opportunities, with even more new locations and roles to choose from.

We offer a mix of residential, non-residential or community-based roles and a handful of in-house roles throughout the summer and half-term programmes, providing the perfect opportunity for you to top up your income over the holidays.
