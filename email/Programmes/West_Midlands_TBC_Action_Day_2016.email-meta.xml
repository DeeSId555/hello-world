    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

We would like to invite you to our Big Sleepout event taking place on Friday 4th March!
What is the Big Sleepout we hear you say? We have organised a Sleepout event to raise awareness for the homeless in the Black Country. The event is only open to NCS graduates and there are a few things to run past you before the event:

It will be taking place on Friday 4th March from 7pm until 7am on Saturday 5th March. This means you will be sleeping outside overnight.

You will gain entry to the event only by bringing your Eventbrite e-ticket along as well as either a food donation or sponsorship money that you have collected to complete the Sleepout. All donations will be given to a local organisation that supports the homeless in the Black Country.

What do you need to bring with you?
Warm clothes, a sleeping bag, a torch and a sheet of cardboard are the basic requirements needed.

Tickets are available on a first come first serve basis and the deadline to sign up is 12pm on Wednesday 24th February.

You can sign up here:

https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-big-sleepout-black-country-tickets-21354245122



Once you have signed up on Eventbrite, we will be in touch to confirm your place and provide you with the location of the Sleepout. We will also be in touch with your Parent / Guardian and a consent form will be sent out to you which must be completed and returned by Sunday 28th February. No consent form, no entry unfortunately!

Remember, the idea of this is for you to experience what it is like to be homeless. Imagine not having a home to return to every night and having to find somewhere safe and warm to sleep each day. Together we can raise awareness for this issue!
