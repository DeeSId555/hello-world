    <subject>Bite the Ballot Changemakers - get involved!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey Grads!

Remember reading about our opportunity to learn about the power of your political voice during the Bite The Ballot session on NCS? Join the BtB team and become an accredited Changemaker and we will help you organise events and get involved in national movements such as National Voter Registration Drive.

If you want to know more about what these sessions are about please read below.

The next #TeamNVRD meet-ups are next week - can&apos;t wait to see you all! We&apos;ll be bringing all of you together to plan, discuss, and supporting each others&apos; ideas. If you wish to take part or are returning after the first session, you have a choice of two days and locations, to make it easier for you to attend - click the relevant link below to get your free Eventbrite ticket (make sure you only sign up to one!):

Thursday 14th January in Waterloo (Elizabeth House, 39 York Road, London, SE1 &amp;NQ)
Friday 15th January in Kentish Town (Highgate Studios, 53-79 Highgate Road, London, NW5 1TL)


If you can&apos;t attend either, please email graduates@the-challenge.org.

What does it involve?

Changemakers will participate in three main activities between February and May 2016:

Participation: Help BTB with their National Voter Registration Drive in early February.
Online and Offline Social Action: Bring your local communities together to talk about the big issues.
Accountability and Decision Making: Organise and take part in your local &apos;Leaders Live&apos; event, getting the chance to question and hold to account the people who make the big decisions where you live.

Why should I take part?

You&apos;ll become an accredited Changemaker, with the opportunity to train future generations of young people on everything you&apos;ve learned.

You&apos;ll learn loads of new skills, including campaign planning, effective social media, political advocacy, fundraising, and so many more!

You&apos;ll get VIP access to a range of future opportunities with BTB, including travel, international training and employment.

Our first BtB session consisted of ideas for how you would engage a community you care about for National Voter Registration Drive (NVRD) from February 1st - 7th. At the end of the session, everyone was called to action to:

a) Register to vote: see here for more information about registering to vote, and here to register
b) Make your NVRD ideas come to life and help us make history this February

Bite the Ballot and The Challenge are going to make history this February. We invite you to be there.
