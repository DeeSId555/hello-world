    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}


Missed out on Action Day? Do you want to get more involved in your community?

We have a really great Easter Holiday volunteering opportunity on Wednesday 6th and Saturday 9th April 2016.


A group of NCS graduates taking part in the Reaching Communities programme have designed a great event raising awareness on the topics of Discrimination, Sexual Health and Mental Health. On Wednesday 6th April from 17:45 - 20:00 we will be finalising plans and buying and designing resources for our big event on Saturday 9th April from 14:00 - 17:00 at Redbridge Library.


We would love for you to get involved and help out as there will be loads to do on Wednesday and on the event day including:



· Helping plan and create resources for the event
· Helping set-up the event on the day
· Running the different games
· Helping with face painting/and other arts and crafts
· And lots more
