    <subject>Last YB meeting before Christmas!</subject>
    <textOnly>NCS Youth Boarders,

Thanks for all of you who attended the last Youth Board meeting - we made great process deciding on an idea for your social action event in March.

There were many great ideas on the day, but the team agreed to run a Tolerance fair/event with the aim to promote tolerance and reduce prejudice in society.

Kike and Molly will be our Project Managers, however there are many other roles to get involved in including Marketing, Logistics and Finance. Please do have think before the next meeting which one of these you want to get involved in and also bring some ideas for what we want this Tolerance event to look like!

We&apos;ll have a shorter, one-hour meeting on Wednesday 16th December 530-630pm before Christmas just to finalise some off the details. This will be at The Challenge office. (Elizabeth House, York Road, SE1 7NQ). 

Look forward to seeing you all there!
