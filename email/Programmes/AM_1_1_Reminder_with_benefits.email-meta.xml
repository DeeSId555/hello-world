    <textOnly>APPLIED TO BE AN ASSOCIATE MENTOR?

You&apos;ll want to after reading this!
Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As you know, we’re looking for NCS Graduates to come back to NCS this year and volunteer as Associate Mentors on the programme! Working alongside our staff, this role is to support this year’s participants to get the most out of NCS.

As a reward for volunteering with us over the summer, we&apos;re offering you a coaching programme to help you gain the skills to be a Senior Mentor in the future (one of our paid roles)

If you sign up as an Associate Mentor and volunteer this year, you will be invited to some training later this year (between October-December) to help you prepare for one of our paid roles. Whilst we cannot guarantee you a job with us next year as it will depend on your age and suitability, everyone can complete this training for experience and skill development!



Also, as an addition to the Associate Mentor training there will also be training in Hosting. This will enable you to host MPs and Dragons (business professionals) on our programme. This will be added on to the standard training  but is compulsory for anyone who wants the amazing opportunity of hosting one of our VIPs!

HAVE WE CONVINCED YOU?

CLICK HERE TO APPLY!

Your application form is specific to you, and you can only submit it once.

Please make sure that you do not share the link to your form with anyone else - they must access it through the email they receive from The Challenge.
If you have questions on the role please let us know by emailing tcs.bucksandberks@the-challenge.org

Good luck!

Amy (NCS Graduates Team) and Steph (Associate Mentor Lead)
