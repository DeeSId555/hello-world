    <textOnly>NCS Associate Mentor application updates

Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Here are a few important updates regarding your application to be an NCS Associate Mentor this summer.

1) Additional assessments -  please reserve your space!

If you haven&apos;t yet attended an assessment, we are running just two more next week. You can find out more information and sign-up HERE. https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/associate-mentor-back-up-assessments-tickets-25860710080
PLEASE NOTE: If you have already attended an assessment you will not be required to attend another.

2) If you&apos;re going to be 18 or over before the end of August...

You will need to have a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. These can take several weeks to process so if you haven&apos;t started the application yet, click here and get going! https://staffing.the-challenge.org/assets/2016DBSinstructionsAMs.pdf
If you have already started your application but not yet completed it, make sure you finished it as soon as possible!
If you already completed your application, well done!
Once you have received your DBS certificate, you will need to scan it and email it to samuel.hepher@the-challenge.org. You will then need to bring the original copy to your first day on the programme.

3) Wave allocation confirmations:

You will receive an email with confirmation of your allocated waves on Friday 24th June.
Seven days before your start date on each of your waves, you will receive an email with further information about locations, times and contacts.
After that, you will receive a call from your Assistant Programme Manager who will answer any questions you have ahead of your placement.

If you have any questions, please email samuel.hepher@the-challenge.org.

See you soon!
