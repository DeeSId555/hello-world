    <subject>URGENT: Youth Board Meeting - TOMORROW</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi All Youth Boarders,

Thank you to all that attended the meeting last week it was very productive and definitely added to the IGNITE sign ups.

We were due to meet again next Monday but unfortunately this is not possible as I will be on training until late. Therefore so that we can get two more meetings in before the Christmas break it would be great if we can meet TOMORROW (1st of December 2015).

It will be at the same place Greenwich West Community Centre  141 Greenwich High Road SE10 8JA between 17:30 and 19:00.

I appreciate that this is short notice but I hope that as many of you as possible can try to make it.

Many Thanks
