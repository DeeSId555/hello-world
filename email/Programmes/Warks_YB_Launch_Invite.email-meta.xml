    <subject>Youth Board Launch Sat 7th November</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

The North Birmingham youth board launch is finally here and you are part of it! We have a great year planned designed for you to get loads out of it and have a great time.

It all starts Saturday 7th November at 12.45pm.

The launch is a chance for you to find out about what being on the Youth Board involves, meet your fellow Youth Board members, and have some fun!

Here are all the details you need for the day:
Where to meet: Signing Tree Centre, Ladywood Road, Birmingham, B16 8SZ 12:45pm on Saturday 7th November.

Alternative meeting place (if you don&apos;t know where to find the Signing Tree Centre): In front of Birmingham Library by 12.15pm latest. A mentor in a staff hoody will walk to the venue from this point so don&apos;t be late.

When and Where does it finish? After the training we will all walk over together to Broadway Plaza, 220 Ladywood Middleway, Birmingham, EN B16 8LP. This is a 5 minute walk from the Signing Tree Centre. We expect to finish at about 4.15pm at Broadway Plaza.

Do I need to bring anything? No, you don&apos;t need to bring anything but yourself.

If you are coming please email me or text me (include your name) and let me know by Sunday 1st November at the latest. If you want to take part in youth board but can&apos;t come to the launch, just message me and let me know.
