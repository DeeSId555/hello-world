    <textOnly>Hi Project Connect!



SO...thanks to your new social media skills we have a really exciting opportunity for you!



We have been asked to run two trainings for community groups in West Berkshire for the Community Council in Berkshire!  These will be:-



1) The basics in social media (theory)



2) Using your social media better! (practical)



Please fill in this doodle poll if you would like to be involved. If you are not free on these dates let me know and we will try to find another date. We will meet to plan the training beforehand, at a time convenient to most people.

Please be aware that I will be out of the office from 30th April- 17th May so may not answer your query until the 18th May!



Thanks so much!



Amy
