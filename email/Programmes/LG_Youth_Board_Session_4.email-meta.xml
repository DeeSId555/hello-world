    <textOnly>Good Afternoon All,

I hope you had a great Christmas break and wish you all a happy new year.

We will be having our 4th Youth Board meeting next Tuesday 12/01/2016. Please meet in upstairs in McDonald&apos;s Greenwich 17:00-18:30. It will be great if you can bring along any information collected or actions taken since the last meeting with Lisa. Evangeline has been nominated to chair the meeting. hopefully you have been discussing  your event among yourselves and have some ideas to bring to the meeting. As we have a very small budget for our youth board meetings we have opted for McDonald&apos;s as it is no cost to us so please feel free to bring along money to buy a drink.
Please confirm by return email. whether or not you will be attending and ask any questions you may have.

See you all on the 12th

Regards
