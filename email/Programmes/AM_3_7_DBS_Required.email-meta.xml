    <textOnly>DBS CHECK REQUIRED
Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations again on submitting a successful application. We hope you are looking forward to attending your Assessment event.

As you will be over the age of 18 this summer, you need to complete a DBS check. So, here is the information you need:

What is DBS?

(DBS stands for: Disclosure and Barring Service)



A DBS certificate is a check that is done to look at someoneâ€™s criminal record, to ascertain how suitable they are to work with different groups of vulnerable people (including children, young people and some adults)



Do I really need for a DBS check?

All Associate Mentors and Senior Associate Mentors who will be over the age of 18 when they work with us this summer need to have a DBS check.



You cannot work on the programme without one.



How much does it cost?

It is completely free for you.



How do I apply for a DBS check?

There are two parts to the process:



1) Online application

2) Taking some documents along to a Post Office



1: The Online Application


Click here to go to our DBS provider, GB Group

You need to provide an organisation PIN &amp; secret word. These are:

YOU MUST APPLY USING THE SAME EMAIL ADDRESS THAT THIS EMAIL WAS SENT TO
otherwise we will not be able to match your DBS to your records.

2: The Documents



You will need to take some documents to be checked at a local Post Office


You will be told what documents you need when you apply
Not all post offices can check the documents.
- you can ask at your nearest Post Office whether they offer &quot;DBS Verification Service&quot;
- or click here for a full list of Post Offices you can use
