    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

What does &quot;Brexit&quot; mean for young people?

In the EU referendum, 75% of 18-25s voted to remain in the European Union. However now that Britian has voted to Leave, the new Prime Minister will need to negotiate with the EU to shape what our new relationship with Europe will look like. This will involve many things that affect young people&apos;s lives and futures.

Livity (a youth marketing agency) are looking for young people help create a national campaign in response to the EU referendum result and make Brexit as positive as possible for young people and to ensure that young people&apos;s views, demands and ideas are fully represented in the negotiations.

Wednesday 27th of July, Thursday 28th of July and/or Friday 29th of July from 14:00 - 19:00.
