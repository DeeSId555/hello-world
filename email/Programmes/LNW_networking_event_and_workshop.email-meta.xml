TUESDAY 5th APRIL 2016

NCS NETWORKING CHARITY EVENT

Just five spaces available for our charity networking event on the 7th floor of the Tower Building in Waterloo tomorrow, April 5th 2016.

We&apos;ll be running an exclusive networking workshop beforehand to give you the skills you need to succeed during the evening of networking, which you can then put into practice immediately. There will be opportunity to explore learn about the paid work we have on offer for everyone over 18 (including NCS grads!) as you take in the beautiful London skyline and browse more opportunities available from our charity partners.

Time: 5pm - 7.30pm

Location: The Tower Building (7th Floor), 11 York Road, London SE1 7NX.

All profits donated to Brent Food Bank

The Challenge will donate all proceeds from the evening to our chosen charity partner, Brent Food Bank. In addition to providing food banks to combat hunger the area, Brent Food Bank are raising funds to purchase a washer-dryer and a tea urn to further support young mothers in the area with their everyday needs, and provide a comfortable and safe environment for them in the centre.

The Challenge is a fast-growing social enterprise that connects and inspires people across Britain to strengthen their communities. The Challenge is the largest provider of the National Citizen Service (NCS) and this summer will support 38,000 young people on the programme.
