    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

We&apos;re very happy to tell you that you have been allocated a place on the Operation Brightside project for NCS Action Day 2016, this Saturday 5th
March.


The details of the event are as follows:

Time: 11:00 - 16:00
Meeting point: 639 Enterprise Centre, 639 High Rd, Tottenham, N17 8AA
Description: Run by the Waltham Forest, Haringey and Enfield Youth Board, Operation Brightside is a project for young people to reach out and help some of the most vulnerable people in North London. Come along and help prepare care packages with essential items for people living rough, and then head out to distribute them to homeless people around Haringey.

IMPORTANT: We expect the project to be very popular so if you turn up late, you may not be able to take part.
REMEMBER! If you attend this project, you can collect your FREE ticket to our awesome NCS Action Day 2016 Celebration, from 16:00 - 20:30 at Conway Hall, Holborn, WC1R 4RL.

Here, you&apos;ll be able to take part in interactive workshops and stalls with amazing organisations such as ICS, Sport Relief, Bite the Ballot and loads more.

Headlining the event we have I Love Live’s most established discovery Joshua KYEOT and MC Infecta! DJing for the event we have Represent FM’s resident House DJ Lorelle! Click here to find out more!
