Digital Storytelling workshop for NCS students

Thursday 30th and Friday 31th of October between 10am – 4pm.

This is a great opportunity for you to be your own director and producer. You will learn how to make, edit and publish films with your smartphone! We want to inspire you to be creative and imaginative through the films you create. We are working in partnership with Sky News who will feature all content filmed at the workshop onto their digital platform Stand Up BE Counted. Not only will your content be seen by an international audience, but it will look fantastic on your CV and personal statement.

For those of you thinking about a career in the media and film-making, this will be a great way for you to learn valuable skills without the need of expensive equipment. You will also be offered a chance to have career mentoring with a media professional after the workshop.

Not only is this workshop free, but YOU will have the chance to win a flip cam or a selfie stick for producing the best film.
