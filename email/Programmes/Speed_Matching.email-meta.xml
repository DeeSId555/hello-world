    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

There is a new opportunity for a half day work experience placement at the Challenge. We are looking for young people to be a part of a panel to select organisations with volunteering opportunities for young people. These organisations will then be put forward to take part in a speed matching session during this year&apos;s NCS with The Challenge summer programme.

The work experience will be from 2-5pm on the 9th April at the Challenge offices in the Custard Factory. Successful candidates will be fully briefed beforehand, ask questions as part of the panel and will help staff deliberate on which organisations to put forward to be a part of the speed matching sessions on the 2014 summer programme.

There is a limit of just 3 places so if you want to take part in this opportunity please email tom.haigh@the-challenge.org with an explanation of why you would like to take up this opportunity by Thursday 3rd April.

Thanks
