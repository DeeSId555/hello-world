    <subject>Next NCS Youth Board meeting: Wednesday 9th December</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Youth Boarders,

I&apos;m pleased to announce that the next NCS Youth Board meeting will be on Wednesday 9th December (5pm-7pm) at the Waterloo Action Centre (SE1 7AA).

We&apos;ll be deciding the final idea for your social action project so bring as many of your ideas as you can to the table. The Challenge staff will be on hand to help you make the most of your suggestions and make your project come to life.

Look forward to seeing you all there,
