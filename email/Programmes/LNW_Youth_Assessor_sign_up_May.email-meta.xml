    <subject>Youth Assessors, have you been to a staff assessment yet?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Huge thanks to everyone who&apos;s been a Youth Assessor so far! You&apos;ve done a brilliant job and have contributed to us being able to hire some exceptional staff for NCS this summer.

Anyone who hasn&apos;t had the chance yet (or wants to come to another one), please see below for all the dates we&apos;ve got available in May. Reply to this email with the date(s) that you would like to attend, and we&apos;ll send you further details!

There are only three places for Youth Assessors per date, so allocations will be on a first-come-first-served basis.
