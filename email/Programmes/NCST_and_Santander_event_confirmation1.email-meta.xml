    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName}!


Congratulations on securing a place to volunteer alongside the NCS Trust and Santander this Friday - competition was tight, so we&apos;re delighted to be able to invite you along.

Before you come you need to fill out this short form by 6pm tomorrow - if you have any problems getting that done then give me a call or text on 07587 037601.

Attached is a letter that you can give to your teachers to explain your absence. Again, any problems either you or your teacher can give me a call to discuss the day.

Make sure you really think about any questions you might want to ask the professionals who are also volunteering with you on Friday - they have absolutely loads of experience and knowledge in all different areas, so make good use of the chance to talk to them and get networking.

See you on Friday!

Megan
