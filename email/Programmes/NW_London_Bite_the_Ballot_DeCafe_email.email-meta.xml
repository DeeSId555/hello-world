    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},




Bite the Ballot and Twitter UK invite you for one night only to DeCafe with us! You may share your views online, but do you think you can talk abut these views with your communities?



DeCafe is a chance for Londoners to come together and discuss issues they care about in local coffee shops. Tomorrow you&apos;ll have the chance to get involved in running the discussions and learn how to use Bite the Ballot&apos;s new voting app.



This is going to be a fantastic evening to share your thoughts, your opinions, listen to others, challenge misconceptions, and explore solutions!


When
Wednesday 16th March from 18:00 - 19:30

Where
Twitter UK, 20 Air Street, London, W1B 5AG
