    <textOnly>Hi Grads,

This is an email to remind you that, if you haven&apos;t applied already, the deadline for Associate Mentor and Senior Associate Mentor applications is the 8th of May!

APPLY HERE

TOPS TIPS:

All applications are welcome and extra support is available to make sure you can get the most out of this experience!
Detail is important! - we want to hear about why you want to do it and what you can offer!
Refer to your experience, what did your mentor do to guide you through, did you have an AM on your wave? What did they offer?

Good luck!
