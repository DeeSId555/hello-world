    <textOnly>Hi,

This is a gentle reminder to update absences/withdrawals/dismissals and approve all payroll for your  RAMs and LOs. You have a week to do this, as Evolution will process payments after next Monday.

Please note that Practitioner salaries will now be handled by Staffing.

Please go to your views in Job Applications to approve their payroll. Click on the link below to get to the Job Applications home page: https://na8.salesforce.com/a17/o

For LOs and RAMs go to the view &quot;Payroll approvals Summer-long roles {!Wave__c.Wave_Cluster__c}&quot;.


Thanks!

This is an automatic email, sent when a Challenge week comes to an end.</textOnly>
