    <textOnly>Hello Grad Reps,

The time has come to put your networking and communication skills to the test.

Your Coventry Youth Board has organised a fantastic event to raise awareness for the realities of being homeless!

It will be a fantastic opportunity to re-connect with people from you wave over a great cause as you put your empathy to the test by experiencing what its like to sleep rough for a night. There will be interactive games/sessions, hot drinks/biscuits and some camp fire entertainment and of course some cheesy NCS staff holding down the fort.

You can pitch this event however you like - be creative, or just copy and paste the eventbrite link, its up to you but this is your opportunity to spread the word among your wave so please send it to everyone you&apos;re still in contact with from NCS.

Big Love
