    <textOnly>Hey Grads!

Unfortunately our CAT Team meeting that takes place tomorrow afternoon has been cancelled.

However there is still plenty of chance for you to get involved as our CAT Team offer still stands! You still have the opportunity to run your own social action projects and be funded up to Â£500 for them!

If you are passionate about a cause or topic and want to create a social action project with your grad friends then come along to pitch your idea on NCS Action Day on the 5th March and you could be funded to run it!

More details for this are soon to come so if you have any questions or queries about this or are keen to get involved please email us at tcs.westlondon@the-challenge.org

Best Wishes,

The Core Grad Team</textOnly>
