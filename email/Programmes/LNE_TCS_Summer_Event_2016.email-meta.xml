    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

It&apos;s coming to the end of your year as an NCS Graduate with The Challenge Society, but don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ve got one last event in store!

Are you missing your NCS friends? Wondering about your future? We have the cure!

Monday 1st August is our Summer Kick Off 2016!
12:00 - 17:30 at Big Creative Education, E17 5SD

It will be a day to reunite with your NCS friends, discover career opportunities from national charities and celebrate all your achievements!

Here&apos;s how it&apos;s going to go down...

Daytime

You&apos;ll have the chance to see your NCS friends and take part in a career workshop together. We have a variety of well known, national charities ready to guide you and help you on your way!

You will then get the chance to impress your chosen charity by using your imagination and skills to create a fundraiser for them.
Afternoon

Later on you&apos;ll get to pitch your fundraiser idea to our panel of Dragons from the Regional Youth Board. If you impress them, you&apos;ll win £££ to put your ideas into action!

This is also when you get to really reunite with your NCS friends, listen to some live music and celebrate the end of your TCS year!
Psst...
... there&apos;s a bonus at the end of summer!

The team who raises the most funds for their charity partner by end of summer will get a secret prize....!
So if you&apos;d like to come...
