    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}!

NCS Action day is just round the corner and there are a few things we&apos;d thought to let you know before we see you all on Saturday.

+ If we can meet at the New Eltham Methodist church 435-439 Footscray Road, New Eltham, London SE9 3UL for 9:30am

+ Please make sure you bring all the purchased items and donations on the day so we can make super useful packs to give out throughout the day.

+ Please wear comfortable clothing as we will be spending the day walking.

+ Also it would be great if you could bring a packed lunch.

+ Also do remember to preregister for yourself and your friends for the action day and party in the evening. You can do this by &gt;&gt; clicking this link&lt;&lt;

The NCS Action day Party consists of A huge reunion event for over 400 NCS graduates from across London who have been involved in Action Day. There will be performances from artists including Infecta and Joshua KYOTE and a DJ set from Lorelle (from Represent Radio). Starts at 16:00 in Holborn and you will either get a FREE ticket by attending a volunteering event or pay via Eventbrite.

You will also be getting the NCS volunteer hoodie!

Look out for the reminder text and we will see you there!

Best,

Bromley and Bexley team</textOnly>
