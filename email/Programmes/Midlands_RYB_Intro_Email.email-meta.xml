    <subject>Invite to Midlands Regional Youth Board</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I would like to invite you to be part of the Regional Youth Board. The opportunity to be involved is only for NCS Leaders and one selected person from each &apos;local&apos; youth board.

A quick summary of what it involves:

Attending 3/4 meetings in 2016
Meetings will take place in Birmingham. We can help with transport such as buses, trains or a taxi to the train station if needed.
The Regional Youth Board will review the funding pitches of local youth boards and decide on whether they are successful or not
Get to make key decisions to shape NCS graduate activity locally

The first meeting will be in Birmingham city centre on Tuesday 16th February 2-4pm. Exact location to be confirmed (probably in the Bullring)

If you can&apos;t attend, don&apos;t worry! We will send you a meeting summary afterwards.

Please reply and let me know:

If you want to be a part of Regional youth board
If you can attend the first meeting
If you need any help with transport and what help this might be (i.e. pay for train or a taxi to the train station)

Thanks,

Liam</textOnly>
