    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

If you couldn&apos;t make the first two sessions but would still like to join the Reaching Communities programme, then you still can!

Please come along to our next session this Wednesday 14:00 - 17:00 at Pastures Youth Centre, E11 3DR. We will be joined by Employability Town, who will be running a workshop on Setting Goals, and Achieving Targets - great for anyone trying to manage a lot at one time.

The rest of the progamme is a fantastic opportunity for you to reconnect with your NCS friends, whilst also building skills and gaining great experiences that will look amazing on your CVs and personal statements.


If you have any questions please email ed: edward.mann@the-challenge.org.

Thanks,

Ed
