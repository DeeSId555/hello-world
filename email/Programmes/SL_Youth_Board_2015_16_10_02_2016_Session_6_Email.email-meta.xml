    <subject>NCS Youth Board meeting this Wednesday 10th Feb!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Youth Boarders,

We had a fantastic session last week and made some great progress on your T-Day event, but with less than 4 weeks left before the event itself, there is a lot of work to be done to make it a success!

The finance team has done a great job applying to 02 Think Big for funding and I&apos;ve just got word that another NCS youth board team was successful. It would be good to chase them up and (better yet) apply to several more before the next meeting. Get in touch if you need any help with this.

The logistics team have got a solid plan for the day and a great number of acts to approach, but it&apos;s good idea to start confirming some of these now if possible. We&apos;ll also need a draft of equipment to see if we need to order any of these things early (a banner?)

Marketing team will start their busy period early as its essential to start generating interest in the weeks running up to the event. We&apos;ve got eventbrite and social media pages set up, but now we need to think how we&apos;re &apos;selling&apos; this to the wider public as well as NCS grads.

We&apos;re meeting at the Waterloo Action Centre (Mezzanine level, not the back hall) at 5pm on Wednesday 10th February. Look forward to seeing you all then!
