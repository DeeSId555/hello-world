    <textOnly>Hello Wolverhampton Graduates,

We have a wonderful one off volunteering opportunity happening this Thursday 11th December at The Elders Project, East Park Methodist Church Brooklands Parade, WV1 2ND, from 12pm onwards.

The Elders Project provide a range of activities and facilities for African-Caribbean older people at the Heath Town day centre including craft work and sewing, keep fit and table games.

This Thursday they will be hosting a Christmas Party for their service users and are looking for volunteers to help with activities, talk to the elders and serve food. It will be the second year we have offered this opportunity, last year was great with lots of delicious food, songs and laughter! So if you want to get in the Christmas spirit and volunteer your time for a great cause in your local area get in touch with Rosemary Graham by email heathtown@talktalkbusiness.net or by phone 01902 352944. You will need to contact Rosemary directly for more information and to confirm your attendance and the time you can attend.

Thanks,

The Black Country Team</textOnly>
