    <subject>Regional Youth Board, it&apos;s time to pick your projects!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName}!


You&apos;re on the North London Regional Youth Board, and Action Day this Saturday is officially your time to shine.

NCS Action Day is all about NCS graduates giving back to their communities by volunteering in their local areas, then coming down to our Central London venue (Conway Hall) for an afternoon of workshops and then a gig with the incredible MC Infecta, Joshua KYEOT, and DJ Lorelle. Check out our website here for more information!

Let us know what you&apos;d like to do on Action Day by filling in this short form by 6pm tomorrow - if you have any problems getting that done then give me a call or text on 07587 037601.

After Action Day, our next Regional Youth Board meeting will be from 2pm to 5pm on Wednesday 30th March. It&apos;ll be the session where you get to input into all the incredible projects we&apos;ll be running during the summer (as well as NCS!) so make sure you keep it free.

See you on Saturday!

Megan and Sam
