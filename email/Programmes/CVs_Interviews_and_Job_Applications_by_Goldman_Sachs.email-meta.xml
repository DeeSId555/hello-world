Session Overview

1)  Developing Your Professional Brand

This session will explore what a personal brand is and examine what contributes to building a strong and professional image. We will examine your strengths and unique attributes and help you incorporate this when applying for jobs and when in the workplace!

2) Create Applications and Online Presence

This section looks at going beyond the basic black and white CV to how to ensure your application stands out from the crowd and showcases your personality. We will be looking at creating video applications, how to shine in a Skype interview, building a create CV (with graphs, and colour and pictures and everything) and how to use social media to your advantage!

3) Staying Professional and Maintaining Your Image

Finally we will look at how to maintain a professional image and respond professionally to various situations from the start of your application to the point of employment! We will look at telephone manner, writing a formal email, introductions, negotiation (e.g. changing an interview date), asking for feedback and what to do it if it all goes wrong (e.g. you get showered with muddy water on your way to an interview)!

Do bring along a short introduction about you and how you currently view your personal brand. Also have a think about the industry you want to work in and how you can sell you and your Personal Brand to them!


We look forward to seeing you there!
