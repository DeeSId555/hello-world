Become a Senior Associate Mentor on
NCS with The Challenge!


Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Hello from The Challenge Society!

The Black Country team here at The Challenge HQ have been working hard over the past few months to put together a unique pilot programme of opportunities exclusively for those of you who have been involved with The Challenge Society in 2013!


Are you ready for your next NCS with The Challenge experience?

This summer, we want you to come back and volunteer alongside summer staff, using your knowledge and experience to support and mentor this year&apos;s participants. You will have the choice of volunteering on either NCS Team Challenge week, NCS Real Challenge Design week or NCS Real Challenge Action weekends.

We have three exciting roles that you can apply for:

Summer Senior: You will be working alongside a practitioner during NCS Team Challenge, joining three teams on skills days one and two and on their showcase.

Graduate Dragon: This is your chance to be a dragon, ask teams questions and guide them on their own campaign journey.

Campaign Coach: The Campaign Coach is for those who are passionate about making a difference and committed to helping teams develop their campaign about the local community.

These are all amazing opportunities for you to stay involved in The Challenge Society. You will be given training beforehand and be fully supported by Challenge staff while you are volunteering with us. This is a great chance to gain valuable experience that will help if you want to apply for other summer roles with The Challenge in the future.


Sound good? Then what are you waiting for!
You can apply for all three but a separate application will be needed for each role. The application processes are detailed on each individual job description attached.

If you are interested in being a Senior Associate Mentor during NCS Real Challenge Design, supporting teams and new Associate Mentors, you will be emailed about this opportunity over the next few days.

We’re really looking forward to reading your applications. Good luck!

The Challenge Society Team
