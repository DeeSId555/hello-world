    <textOnly>Ignite Black Country: Get Inspired, Reunite &amp; Spark your Future!

An exclusive event for Black Country NCS Graduates that have taken part in the programme in Walsall, Wolverhampton, Sandwell and Dudley only. If you took part in the programme in a different area, please find your local event through the TCS West Midlands Facebook page.

Ignite is an exciting event that will give you the opportunity to find out where the skills you gained on the programme can take you next and how to apply it to the real world. Take part in interactive workshops and learn new practical skills for the future including First Aid and opportunities to learn about working abroad. Itâ€™s a great chance to re-ignite with your friends, and make new ones!

This event is not to be missed. Do not be the one to hear about it, be the one who was there and experienced it!
