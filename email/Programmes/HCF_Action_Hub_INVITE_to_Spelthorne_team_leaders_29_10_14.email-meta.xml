Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

The Heathrow Community Fund:  Inspiring Youth Programme is funding youth led activities in your area and we want you to be a part of it!

As a leader of {!Contact.Team__c} during the NCS programme you were responsible for co-ordinating and leading your team to collectively deliver a social action campaign.

Next week we are starting a new venture - Action Hubs - in Staines.  This is your opportunity to be part of a vibrant new group of young people exploring the world of social action and creating positive change in your community.

Your NCS campaign was the first leg of your social action journey, Action Hubs are the next step in your Challenge adventure!
