    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for being a part of The Challenge this year! Founded in 2009, The Challenge aims to inspire and connect young people to make a difference in their community.  We believe that it is not acceptable that our country has the lowest level of trust and belonging amongst its citizens in Europe. With your help, we have worked to change this by bringing together young people from different backgrounds and challenging them to strengthen their communities.

Thank you, in particular, for hosting a team of Challengers in your workplace.  Through their visit, our Challengers had the opportunity not only to be inspired about what their own future career path might hold, but also to share and develop their project ideas. This was a great help in their successful pitch for project funds.

This year has been a great year, but we know there is so much more to do if we are to make a permanent difference to levels of trust in our society.  Over the next twelve months you will see us expand our work to reach twice as many young people. We would love you to continue to be a part of this.

Thank you once again for the contribution you have made to the lives of our Challengers!

Yours sincerely,

Craig Morley, Chief Executive on behalf of The Challenge Team</textOnly>
