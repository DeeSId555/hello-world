    <subject>NCS Action Day 2016 - Saturday 5th March</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

If you haven&apos;t already heard, Saturday 5th March is NCS Action Day 2016!

It will be a day to reunite with your NCS friends, help out with amazing social action projects near you, take part in future opportunities workshops and celebrate all your achievements!

The day will be broken down into two parts:

Daytime

Between 11:00 - 16:00, there will be a variety of social action projects taking place around London, led by your local Youth Boards, that you can get involved in. Look out for more details about projects near you in an email you&apos;ll receive at the beginning of next week.

Afternoon/Evening

From 16:00 - 18:00, we&apos;re taking over Conway Hall in central London (25 Red Lion Square, WC1R 4RL) for our Social Action Hub. Here, you&apos;ll be able to take part in interactive workshops and stalls with amazing organisations such as Red Cross, ICS, Sport Relief and loads more. Then from 18:00 - 20:30 it&apos;s celebration time! There&apos;ll be live music, a DJ and prizes, so you can relax and enjoy all the great things you&apos;ve achieved as an NCS graduate!

Supporting you

We&apos;re contacting all of our NCS graduates with additional needs who worked with a Support Worker when they took part in the programme. If you would like to attend NCS Action Day on Saturday 5th March, please reply to this email by the end of Sunday 21st February, and we&apos;ll be in touch about organising extra support to help you enjoy the day!

Thank you,

The Challenge Society</textOnly>
