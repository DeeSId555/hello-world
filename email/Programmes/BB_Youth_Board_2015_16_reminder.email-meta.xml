    <textOnly>Hey everyone,
We are super excited for the first Youth Board meeting of the year.

Look forward to meeting new people and sharing your personal NCS experience, planning the shape that your Youth Board year will take and also completing your first challenge as a Youth Board together.

We will be meeting at
435-439 Footscray Road, New Eltham, London SE9 3UL from 5-7pm.
Please make sure you arrive on time and if you are running late please text or call me on 07908912089.

There will be snacks so get excited and please let me know if you won&apos;t be coming so I know how much food I should buy.

See you all tomorrow...
Steph.</textOnly>
