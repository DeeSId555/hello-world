Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for working with The Challenge. We hope that you enjoyed your wave.

We are always interested in having a supply of back-up staff over the rest of the summer in case our contracted staff members become unavailable.

If you are interested in being considered to work again for The Challenge this summer, please click on the link and provide any availability over the remainder of this summer.

If any relevant opportunities then arise, we will contact you to check if you might be interested in working for us again.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Best wishes,
