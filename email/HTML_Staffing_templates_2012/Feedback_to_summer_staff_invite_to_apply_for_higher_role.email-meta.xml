Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Many thanks for all your work with us this summer. I am writing to you to give you some feedback on your role as {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c} this summer.

{!Job_Application__c.00NC0000005EqFE}

We would therefore like to invite you to apply for the role of  {!Job_Application__c.Recommendation_for_next_year__c} in 2013. If you would like to take up the {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c} role again, you will not need to attend another assessment.

We will contact you again when applications reopen in January 2013.

Best wishes,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
