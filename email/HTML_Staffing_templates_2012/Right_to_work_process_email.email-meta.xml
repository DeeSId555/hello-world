Dear {!Job_Application__c.Contact_Name__c},

Thank you for your interest in The Challenge. We understand that you do not have the right to work in the UK. In order to do so, you may need to apply for permission under the points-based system. To find out about the different tiers, and what you will need for your application, please go to www.direct.gov.uk and search for &quot;Permission to work in the UK&quot;.

Best wishes,
