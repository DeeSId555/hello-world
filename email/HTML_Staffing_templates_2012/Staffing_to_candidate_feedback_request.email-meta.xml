Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope that you enjoyed working with The Challenge this summer. In order to learn more fully your views on your experience, we would be very grateful if you would be able to fill in our Summer Staff Survey. It will take about 15 minutes to fill in, and asks about how you found the application, assessment and training processes, as well as the role itself.

All feedback we get will form part of our complete review of our processes, and will inform how we will work in 2013.
This is your chance to let us know your feedback on The Challenge. We look forward to reading it.

Please click on the link below to start the survey.
