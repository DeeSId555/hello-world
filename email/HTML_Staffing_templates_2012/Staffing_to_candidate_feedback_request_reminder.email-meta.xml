Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We wrote to you on {!Job_Application__c.Date_staff_feedback_request_sent__c}, asking if you could fill in a survey of your experience on The Challenge programme. We would be very grateful if you would take the time to do this, so that we can evaluate the programme and take your suggestions on board.  It will take about 15 minutes to fill in, and asks about how you found the application, assessment and training processes, as well as the role itself.

All feedback we get will form part of our complete review of our processes, and will inform how we will work in 2013.
This is your chance to let us know your feedback on The Challenge. We look forward to reading it.

Please click on the link below to start the survey.
