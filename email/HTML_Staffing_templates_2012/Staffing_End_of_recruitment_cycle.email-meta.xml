Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your application to work with The Challenge this year. Unfortunately, our recruitment cycle for paid positions has come to an end and we have filled all of our vacancies.  In rare circumstances we may invite applicants to attend one to one interviews, in which case these people will be called directly by a member of our team.

If you are still interested in getting involved with The Challenge this year we are now recruiting Project Volunteers. Please see  http://www.the-challenge.org/work-with-us/summer-roles/project-volunteer/  for more information. Otherwise we strongly urge you to apply next year. Applications will re-open in January.

Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
