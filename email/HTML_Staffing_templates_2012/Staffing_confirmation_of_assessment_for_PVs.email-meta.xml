    <textOnly>CONFIRMATION OF YOUR ASSESSMENT

Dear {!HR_Event_Attendance__c.Candidate_Name__c},
 
This is to confirm your group assessment with us on {!HR_Event_Attendance__c.HR_Event_Date__c} at {!HR_Event_Attendance__c.Start_time__c} until {!HR_Event_Attendance__c.End_time__c} at {!HR_Event_Attendance__c.Venue__c} 
{!HR_Event_Attendance__c.Venue_address__c} 
 
The assessment will include various group activities so please wear smart/casual comfortable clothing. Please prepare two &apos;icebreaker games&apos; to share: these are simple games to break the ice with a group about ten people which last for about three minutes.
Click on the link below for directions to the assessment venue.
