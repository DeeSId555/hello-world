Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your continued dedication to bringing people together across boundaries.  I have spent the week visiting programmes in the North-West and Midlands and have been struck again by the amazing experience that you are providing for young people across the country.

One young man I met told me that the experience of being on The Challenge, had changed him, &quot;I used to think that people who didn&apos;t go to a private school like me weren&apos;t people I could be friends with.  I&apos;ve realised that I was being a real snob.  This experience has changed me.&quot;  Another young woman told me, &quot;I&apos;ve realised how judgemental I was.  I thought I had nothing in common with old people and realised they&apos;re just like me.  I want to go back to the centre I visited and volunteer.&quot;

These stories are happening up and down the country and I want to thank you for the work you do in making this a reality. I have included below a note regarding summer staff payroll from Chief Financial Officer, Rob Ovens.


Yours,

Jon Yates
Operations Director


Dear Summer Staff Team Member,

Unfortunately we have had a number of problems with our summer staff payroll, and I am aware that this has caused confusion and some distress to a number of people.

I have now taken personal responsibility to resolve these issues and have spent the past three days working through every person on this week&apos;s payroll with a dedicated team. This has meant that we have had to put back our payroll payment date to Monday 13th August rather than tomorrow, but I hope that this will mean everyone will receive what they are due for all completed waves up to and including Monday 6th August.

Please be aware that in order for us to have time to check future payrolls to ensure their accuracy we will now continue to pay all future payrolls this summer on a Monday.

If you have incurred any bank charges due to the delay in being paid we will reimburse you. In these cases you must submit an expenses claim, with copies of the charges you have incurred.You can submit these using your standard expenses claim form.

My focus is now on reconciling every person who has worked for us this summer, and I am recruiting a team to do this as quickly as possible. We will then be in a position to answer any queries you have about the money you have received. This reconciliation is going to take some time as we have over 1,200 people to check. Once I have further information I will contact you again.

I apologise for the problems that have resulted in delayed and confusing payments but wish to assure you  that every person who has worked for us over the summer will be paid the correct amount for their efforts.


Regards,

Rob Ovens
Chief Financial Officer
