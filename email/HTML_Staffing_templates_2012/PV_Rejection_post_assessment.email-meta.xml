YOUR ASSESSMENT WITH THE CHALLENGE

Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for attending the assessment at The Challenge. Unfortunately, we will not be taking your application further.

Successful candidates demonstrated an impressive aptitude to work with and support young people.
We appreciate you taking the time to apply work with us, however.

Thank you for your interest in The Challenge.

Best wishes,
