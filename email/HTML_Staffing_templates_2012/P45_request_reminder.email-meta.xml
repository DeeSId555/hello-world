Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting your payroll and tax information.
You have indicated that you have a valid P45 which we’d now like you to submit to us to ensure we put you on the correct tax code as indicated on the P45.  Please check that the P45 is current before sending it to us.  The P45 is current if it meets the following criteria:

It is dated in the current tax year which commenced on 6 April 2012.
(If the P45 relates to any previous tax year it is not valid for employment in this tax year)
The P45 relates to your most recent employment and you have not carried out any paid work since you received it

If your P45 meets the above criteria we’ll need to receive it before we process your first payment so please send it to us at your earliest convenience to Mandy Nicholls at the following address:

Evolution Recruitment Ltd
11A Hillgate Place
London
SW12 9ER

If your P45 does not meet the above criteria and is therefore not valid, please make the appropriate declaration by resubmitting your information on the Payroll and Tax Information form:
