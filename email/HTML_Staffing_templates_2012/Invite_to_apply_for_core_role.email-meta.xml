Dear Summer Staff member,

If you enjoyed working on The Challenge and believe in our mission to inspire and connect people to strengthen their community, we would like you to consider applying to work for us full-time.  The majority of our staff were originally summer staff who loved what we are trying to achieve.  The roles we are sharing today are aimed primarily at Senior Mentors, Assistant Programme Leaders, Programme Leaders and Practitioners.

If you are a Senior Mentor, Assistant Programme Leader or Practitioner:

•	Staffing Associate: Play a key role in the attraction, selection and communication with thousands of potential staff and volunteers to work on The Challenge 2013 summer and year-round programme as well as continuing relationships with Challenge staff alumni. Each Associate will be responsible for staffing a particular geographical area.
Job Description

•	Assistant Programme Manager [Only in Birmingham and Manchester]: Build lasting relationships with community groups across your designated local area e.g., a county council.  Set up an inspiring summer The Challenge programme and – where appropriate - plan and deliver The Challenge Society locally for graduates of The Challenge.
Job Description

If you are a Programme Leader or Assistant Programme Leader:

•	Programme Manager: Set the wider vision and manage a team of Assistant Programme Managers as they build lasting relationships with community groups across a large community area (e.g., a number of London Boroughs or a large city).  Ensure an inspiring summer The Challenge programme is set up and – where appropriate - oversee the planning and delivery of The Challenge Society for graduates of The Challenge.
Job Description

•	Staffing Manager: Manage and inspire a team of associates as they work to attract, select and communicate with thousands of potential staff and volunteers.  Provide a strategic overview ensuring that we are planning for the future and take a lead nationally on a strategic issue e.g., advertising, assessment, inclusion, non-summer delivery.
Job Description

To apply send your CV and a one-page letter explaining why you are interested to the named person on the job description.  Apart from Assistant Programme Manager, all roles are available in London, Birmingham and Manchester.
