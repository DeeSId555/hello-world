Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for letting us know you&apos;re interested in NCS. Unfortunately, you’re not in the eligible age range to take part in NCS.

We have other opportunities for you, though!

Once you’re over 18,  you can apply to work on NCS.
If you are aged 17 or 18 this August, check out Step Forward, our 12 month paid school leavers’ programme.

If you have any questions, please email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org or call 0203 542 2400.

Best wishes,

The Challenge (largest provider of NCS)
