    <textOnly>Hi 

Please look at {!Contact.Name}&apos;s record as the SC has confirmed that this YP is withdrawing from The Challenge. Please urgently withdraw them from any wave they are assigned/reserved onto. If they are eligible please arrange a refund.
Click on this link to see the record: {!Contact.Link}

This email has been sent to all Central Ops Admins, so please can whoever gets to this first notify everyone else that this has been dealt with.

Our refund policy is that a refund is available if requested in writing within 14 days of payment. If they paid by card we can refund by the same method (depending when they paid - in some circumstances we may need to send a cheque instead). If they paid by any other means we will refund by cheque. We are not able to issue refunds after this time.

This is a standard email, sent automatically whenever a YP or PG notifies us that they want to withdraw.</textOnly>
