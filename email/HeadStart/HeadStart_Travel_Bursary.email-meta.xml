    <subject>Your Travel Bursary request</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!HS_Activity__c.Young_Person__c}!

Thank you for applying to HeadStart.

We understand from your application form that you would like to request a HeadStart travel bursary. Travel bursaries are designed to support volunteers who would not otherwise be able to attend volunteering placements and workshops due to travel costs or difficulties.

We will provide upfront payment of up to £20 on an oyster card. It should help to cover the cost of any public transport journey to and from your volunteering placement or workshop. A travel bursary is not for taxi use or to help with any form or petrol costs.

If you have a disability or access requirement, which may require you to use a taxi, please indicate this on the form for us to make alternative arrangements.

When choosing your placement, you should consider the cost of travel as we cannot fund volunteers who simply have a long commute and may not be able to cover full travel costs.

Next Steps
1. Ask your parent/guardian to fill out this form (http://goo.gl/forms/7QfPCgSo2G)

2. We will contact you to confirm arrangements


We look forward to having you on HeadStart!
