    <subject>Congratulations! Welcome to HeadStart London!</subject>
    <textOnly>HeadStart | The Challenge

Welcome to HeadStart London, we are really excited to have you on board!

The aim is simple.  If you volunteer with an organisation for 16 hours+ you will get access to exclusive skills workshops and be given a guaranteed interview with  Starbucks or New Look for a paid part-time job.

We would like to invite you to HeadStart London Kick Off event and first workshop:

&apos;Give time. Get Ahead.&apos;
The aim of this workshop is to understand key attributes organisations and employers look for, and how to get the most out of your volunteering experience.

By attending this Kick Off you will be able to automatically log 2 hours to go towards your volunteering target which means you are on your way to that New Look or Starbucks interview!

When: Wednesday 23rd July 12:45pm-4pm
Where: City Hall, The Queen&apos;s Walk, London, SE1 2AA. About 10min walk from London Bridge station and 15 from Tower Hill.  City Hall is on the south bank of the Thames.  Look for the distinctive curved glass building.
RSVP: headstart@the-challenge.org

To be eligible to be invited to interview you must record your volunteering hours by logging on to The Challenge website www.thechallengesociety.org. Below is your unique log in information where you can log and track your hours. It is really important that you log your hours regularly to make sure you are invited for an interview with Starbucks or New Look so please do this as often as you volunteer. We will tell you more about this at Kick Off and in your volunteers guide.
