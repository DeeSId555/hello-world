You only have two days left to apply to be part of HeadStart London, your opportunity to volunteer 16+ hours in return for a guaranteed interview with Starbucks or New Look!

Please click here fill in your application form for HeadStart London, which includes giving us your top three volunteering preferences. If you choose to volunteer with a HeadStart London partner, you can find all the details in our Volunteering Opportunities Booklet.  If you prefer to find your own, we will still get in touch to give you some hints, tips and contacts in your area to get you started.

Once you have applied we will send you an invite to your Kick Off event AND details of your first workshop which will be happening on the same day at City Hall. So apply today to take part in this amazing opportunity!

We look forward to receiving your application!
