    <textOnly>Thank you for hosting a HeadStart Volunteer!


Hello,

You are receiving this email because a young person who has been volunteering with you has recently taken part in the HeadStart programme, which challenges 16- 18-year-olds to volunteer at least 16 hours to access an interview for part-time, seasonal work.

Firstly, we want to thank you for hosting your HeadStart volunteer. Secondly, we wanted to let you know that we will be sending out emails on Monday for each young volunteer who has achieved at least 16 hours of volunteering with you. So please don&apos;t be panicked if you receive a few messages from us at once!

We will simply be asking you to verify the volunteering hours they have logged, which should take a few seconds.

It is really important that these hours are verified, as it will ensure that everyone who has achieved at least 16 hours and is deserving of a job interview is rightfully given the opportuity to access one.

Kind regards,

The HeadStart team
