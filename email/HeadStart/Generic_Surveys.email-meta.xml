Hello,
Congratulations on completing HeadStart!
To better understand the impact of the programme we have a few short surveys for you to complete with regards to the workshops you attended. Some of you may have already completed this survey at the workshop, if you have not please fill out the relevant survey. It will only take a few minutes and it’s vital that we get this information so your help will be hugely appreciated. On completing the survey(s) you will be entered into a prize draw to win a Nandos voucher worth £15.. To be in with a chance of winning a voucher, complete the relevant surveys by this coming Monday.The winners will be announced 2 days later.
