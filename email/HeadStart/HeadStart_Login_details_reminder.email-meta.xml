Remember to Log in your hours


Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope you are enjoying your time on HeadStart and have now started volunteering to complete your 16 hours.

It is important that you log your hours regularly so as to keep track of when you are volunteering and so we know you are on track to complete your 16 hours.

You must have logged your hours by January 31st 2015 so as to be eligible for a guaranteed part-time/seasonal role with Starbucks, New Look or Lloyds.   If you don’t log your hours we won’t know what your progress is and may assume you aren’t taking part in HeadStart.

We have attached a short step by step of how to log your hours.  You must log into www.thechallengesociety.org using your unique username and password

We will be in touch soon to invite you to our second workshop ‘Customer Service in Action’.  Keep an eye on our facebook for regular updates!
