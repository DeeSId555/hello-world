    <subject>Sorry about the confusion!</subject>
    <textOnly>We are very sorry if you have received an email from us that made no sense!

The lovely Joel in our system&apos;s team is updating the HeadStart database and it appears whilst doing so, some very old emails have been triggered that shouldn&apos;t have.
So, on behalf of everyone here at HeadStart,
we are very sorry!

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email us or send us a message on facebook, twitter or instagram and we will get back to you as soon as we can.

Have a great day!</textOnly>
