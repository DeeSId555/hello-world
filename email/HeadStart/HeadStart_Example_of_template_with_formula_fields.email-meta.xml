Your NCS information pack:
final steps and need-to-knows

Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name}, 

NCS is just around the corner! To prepare, please read this pack carefully. There’s lots of important information here, including:

- Your NCS Timetable – shows meeting points, dates, times and accommodation for the residential parts. You will need to organise {!Contact.FirstName}’s transport to the meeting points and from the return points. Click here to see this: {!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}
-Your NCS Information Booklet – gives you essential information about NCS, including packing lists and how to contact us in an emergency. Click here to see this: {!Wave__c.Programme_booklet__c}

As {!Contact.FirstName}’s parent or guardian, there are two important things you need to do before {!Contact.FirstName} starts NCS:

1. Please contact us to make sure we have a correct emergency phone number for you. 
It’s your responsibility to make sure we have a correct number and someone will be available to take calls on it.

2. Please contact us if there have been any changes to the medical, support or dietary information you gave us about {!Contact.FirstName}, or if you need to give us any other details.
You’re responsible for making sure we have full and up-to-date medical, support and dietary information, including details of any medication*.

You can call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org if you have any questions or need to give us any information. Please quote {!Contact.FirstName}’s NCS ID number: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}. 

If  {!Contact.FirstName} can no longer attend NCS, please contact us so we can offer their place to another young person.

We’re really looking forward to welcoming  {!Contact.FirstName} to NCS!
