Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

HeadStart London is an exciting new programme from The Challenge for NCS Graduates which will support you to make a difference in your local community, whilst gaining new skills and experience to help you get ahead.


The HeadStart programme is made up of three simple steps:

Volunteer for at least 16 hours with a local charity. We’ll help you find the volunteering opportunity that fits with your interests and your free time.

Engage in exclusive skills workshops, developed with leading employers to give you the right skills and aptitude to get ahead.

Get a guaranteed interview for a paid part-time or seasonal job with New Look or Starbucks after completing 16 hours or more volunteering.



HeadStart will help you:

Gain skills and experience

Be more employable

Stand out on your UCAS form

Meet new people or get back together with friends from your wave
