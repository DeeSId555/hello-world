You only have two days left to apply to be part of HeadStart London, your opportunity to volunteer 16+ hours in return for a guaranteed interview with Starbucks or New Look! Places with HeadStart charity partners are limited so apply quickly to avoid disappointment.

How to apply

Click here to apply. Deadline is 12th October 2014

You can read more about the HeadStart charity partners on The Challenge Society Website.

Still wondering if HeadStart is for you?

Here is a short video of the Mayor of London, together with some of our corporate partners and HeadStart graduates, explaining the power of volunteering in getting you a head in the work place.

What’s next?

If you are finding your own volunteering placement you will automatically have a place on the programme. If you have chosen to volunteer with a HeadStart partner, we will be in touch next week to let you know if you have been successfully matched with this charity. You will then receive a confirmation email along with an invitation to our Kick-Off event and first workshop, happening on Saturday 18th October at City Hall - save the date!

If you have any questions feel free to email us at or contact us on our facebook page.


We look forward to receiving your application!
