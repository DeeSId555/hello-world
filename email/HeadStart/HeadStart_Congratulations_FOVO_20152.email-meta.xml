    <subject>Welcome to HeadStart!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}...

Welcome to finding your own volunteering opportunity!  We are really excited to have you on board with HeadStart.

Here&apos;s some information about findning your own volunteering opportunity. There are many benefits to finding your own volunteering placement, you can:

Find a placement close to where you live

Use your initiative and talk about it during an interview

Persue your interests and get creative with your search

Show your leadership through proactively finding your own placement.


Whether your family and friends know somewhere, there’s a local charity shop down the road, or you are finding something completely new, we have created a brief guide to help you with your search.

If you are already volunteering with a charity, not for profit organisation or even at your school or college (for example, tutoring younger students) that all counts!!

We’ve also written a short letter of introduction for you to print and take with you to any potential charity to explain what HeadStart is.

Once you have found a placement please update and edit your profile on the HeadStart website, your login details are at the top of this email. If you’re having trouble please get in touch at headstart@the-challenge.org and we can try and help

Before you start your volunteering, please complete our baseline survey - this should be nice and easy to do on your phone!

See you soon,

The HeadStart team
