    <subject>It&apos;s almost Christmas - Volunteer &amp; bring some cheer!</subject>
    <textOnly>*|MC:SUBJECT|* 

Give time, get ahead this Christmas! 

What’s next? 

In the new year, we will send out invitations for workshops and interviews. The date and time of your workshop will depend on which employer you have chosen. 

We can only invite you to workshops and interviews once you have completed 16 hours or more of volunteering so keep it up and log those hours after each session! 


In case you&apos;ve forgotten, we&apos;ve included the HeadStart journey map 
for you to have a look at again.
