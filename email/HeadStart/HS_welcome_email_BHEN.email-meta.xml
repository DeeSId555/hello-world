Thank you for recently expressing an interest in HeadStart London.


HeadStart London would provide you with a unique opportunity to volunteer at least 16 hours in your community supported by the HeadStart London Team.  You will have the chance to attend employability workshops, communications coaching used by FSTE 100 business leaders and a guaranteed job interview for part-time or seasonal work with New Look or Starbucks.


We will be emailing you a link to your personalised application form along with a guide to the volunteering opportunities local to you on Monday 30th June.  Once you have applied we would like to invite you to our kick off event on Wednesday 16th July, 2pm  at City Hall, The Queen&apos;s Walk, London SE1 2AA.


If you have any questions please feel free to email us at headstart@the-challenge.org or contact us on our facebook page /Londonheadstart.
