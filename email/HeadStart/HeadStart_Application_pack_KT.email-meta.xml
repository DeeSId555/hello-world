HeadStart Application Pack

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Around this time last year you would just have been getting ready to start your NCS with the Challenge journey. We want to take a minute to let you know about a new programme The Challenge has created, exclusively for NCS graduates.

HeadStart London is an exciting new programme which will support you to make a difference in your local community, whilst gaining new skills and experience to help you get ahead.

The HeadStart programme is made up of three simple steps:
1. Volunteer for at least 16 hours with a local charity. We’ll help you find the volunteering opportunity that fits with your interests and your free time.
2. Engage in exclusive skills workshops, developed with leading employers to give you the right skills and aptitude to get ahead
3. Get a guaranteed interview for a paid part-time or seasonal job with New Look or Starbucks after completing 16 hours or more volunteering.

HeadStart will help you:
-  Gain skills and experience
-  Be more employable
-  Stand out on your UCAS form
-  Meet new people or get back together with friends from your wave
For more details see HeadStart website.

To confirm your place, please complete your unique application form here. The application deadline is Sunday 20 July.

HeadStart is all about supporting you to volunteer with a charity that is right for you. To make sure this happens, we are giving you the choice to either volunteer with a HeadStart charity partner or find your own opportunity. All HeadStart charity partner opportunities are detailed in our Volunteering Opportunities Booklet – you will get the chance to tell us your preferences in the application form. If you prefer to find your own, we will still get in touch to give you some hints, tips and contacts in your area to get you started.

After you have filled out your form, we will send you an official invite to our HeadStart Kick-Off event which is happening later this month at City Hall.

If you have any questions feel free to email us at headstart@the-challenge.org or contact us on our facebook page /Londonheadstart.

We look forward to receiving your application!
