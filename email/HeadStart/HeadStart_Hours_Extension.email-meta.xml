{!HS_Activity__c.YP_First_name_from_HS_Application_Form__c}! We can see youâ€™ve almost logged the magic 16 hours of volunteering, but you need just a little more time, so we&apos;re extending the deadline for an extra week!


We&apos;ve had a few people ask us if they can use hours they&apos;re volunteering outside of their HeadStart placement to access the interviews and workshops. The Answer? OF COURSE YOU CAN! Any volunteering you are doing counts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also if you still need to volunteer a few more hours you can come and volunteer on an exclusive HeadStart project Saturday 30th January and Saturday 6th February.
