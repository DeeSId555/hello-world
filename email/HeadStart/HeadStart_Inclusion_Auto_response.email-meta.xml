Thank you for applying to HeadStart

Dear {!HS_Activity__c.YP_First_name_from_HS_Application_Form__c},

Thank you for choosing to apply to the HeadStart London programme.

HeadStart London is a low-intensity programme - our team match young people with local charities who need young volunteers. A HeadStart member of staff will attend the first day of volunteering with the charity, however we will then take a step back to allow young people to develop a relationship with the organisation with which they are volunteering.

As the majority of time spent volunteering will be staffed by the local charity rather than HeadStart staff, HeadStart is not able to provide a support worker for young people. The safety of our young people is at the forefront of everything we do, and we aim to enable you to fully enjoy your volunteering experience and feel safe and supported while on the programme. We will work hard to find a volunteering opportunity which is suited to your individual needs, although we realise this may not always be possible.

Thank you for providing information about your support needs in your application form. A member of the HeadStart team will be in touch with you soon to discuss further your volunteering options.

If you have any questions or concerns, then please don’t hesitate to contact the HeadStart by email at headstart@the-challenge.org.
