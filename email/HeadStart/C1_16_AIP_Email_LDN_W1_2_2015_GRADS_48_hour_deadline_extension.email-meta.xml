We believe in second chances!


Why not finish what you&apos;ve started?

The deadline for your HeadStart application has now passed but this doesn&apos;t have to be the end of the road!

We&apos;ve decided to give you guys a 48 hour deadline extension! Uh huh, we&apos;re just that nice.

Go to the HeadStart website, log back in to your profile and complete your application. It will take you 10 minutes max!



Also, we figured why not come to one of our Kick Off events this week?


Coming along to a Kick Off will give you the chance to see what HeadStart is all about, meet other HeadStarters and the HeadStart team!
