    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As an NCS graduate, you are eligible to apply for HeadStart - a new programme The Challenge has developed in partnership with Starbucks and New Look to give you the skills and experience to get ahead.

HeadStart offers an exciting way for you to build on the experiences gained through NCS, whilst getting back together with friends from your wave.

The HeadStart programme is made up of three simple steps:

Volunteer for at least 16 hours with a local charity. This can be something you do already or a new opportunity found through your college or Do-it.org.

Engage in exclusive skills workshops, developed with leading employers to give you the right skills and aptitude to get ahead.

Get a guaranteed interview for a paid part-time/seasonal job with New Look or Starbucks
