Final chance to choose your interview preference!

Dear {!HS_Activity__c.YP_First_name_from_HS_Application_Form__c},

We hope you&apos;re having a great time volunteering and a huge well done
if you&apos;ve given 16 hours or more!

This is your chance to make a final decision on which employer you want to interview with. We know it might be hard to decide between all our fantastic opportunites (including our new partner, the Berkeley Group). To make it easier, we have created a handy Employer Guide to give you the lowdown on the different jobs/internships available and when you will need to be free. You can also find this attached.

Make sure you read it carefully!

Once you have made your choice,  click here to confirm your final interview preference

You have until 15th December to decide.

Good luck!

The HeadStart Team

If you have any queries, please email headstart@the-challenge.org
