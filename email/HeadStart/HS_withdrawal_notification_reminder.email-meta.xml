    <textOnly>Hi {!HS_Activity__c.HS_Owner_First_Name__c},

It has been one week since the YP asked to withdraw from HeadStart and no action has been recorded.  Please look at {!Contact.Name}&apos;s record and contact them to see if you can change their mind and find a way for them to remain with HeadStart. Click on this link to see the record: {!HS_Activity__c.Link}

If you are able to change their mind, then please the following fields:
Remove the date from the &apos;Date of HS withdrawal notification&apos; field, and
Update their &apos;HS Status&apos; field

If you are not able to change their mind, then please put the date of your conversation with them into the &apos;Withdrawal confirmed by HS Team&apos; field, so that it is clear that they are definitely withdrawing. Please also note their reason for withdrawal.  In addition, please clear their &apos;Volunteering Placement&apos;

This is a standard email, sent automatically whenever a YP notifies us that they want to withdraw.</textOnly>
