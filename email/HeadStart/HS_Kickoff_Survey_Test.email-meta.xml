    <textOnly>HeadStart | The Challenge

Welcome to HeadStart London, we are really excited to have you on board!

The aim is simple. If you volunteer with an organisation for 16 hours+ you will get access to exclusive skills workshops and be given a guaranteed interview with  Starbucks or New Look for a paid part-time job.

We would like to invite you to HeadStart London Kick Off event and first workshop:

&apos;Give time. Get Ahead.&apos;
The aim of this workshop is to understand key attributes organisations and employers look for, and how to get the most out of your volunteering experience.

By attending this Kick Off you will be able to automatically log 2 hours to go towards your volunteering target which means you are on your way to that New Look or Starbucks interview!

Before arriving at the Kick Off you must fill in this survey. If you have any problems please contact us.
