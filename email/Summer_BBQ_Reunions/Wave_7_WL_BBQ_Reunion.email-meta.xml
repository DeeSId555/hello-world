Wave 7 Summer Reunion BBQ Invitation

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Yay! Summertime is here again! It&apos;s been almost a year since last years Challenge and after speaking to a number of you from different teams, everyone was in agreement. A summer barbecue reunion which is easy to get to would be TOTALLY awesome.  Lets come together, relax, have fun, catch up and talk to us about what&apos;s going in your lives. We have lots of wonderful opportunities to offer you for your future and this is an excellent time for us to chat about where you are at and what we can do for you. Fun and free hugs included.

We&apos;d love to know if you are coming and we also need to work out how much food to bring.

Check out the Facebook event and RSVP here:
