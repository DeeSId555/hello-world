Wave 9 Summer Reunion BBQ Invitation

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

We&apos;ve been calling your WL Wave up over the last week to get your opinions on who is interested in getting together for a reunion and almost everyone has said it&apos;s a great idea and they can come! We&apos;ve been doing BBQ reunions for other waves over the past two weeks and you guys have asked for the same. So we shall deliver! It was initially going to be over lunch time but after making some calls, some of you will still be in college so we&apos;ve moved it to the afternoon / evening.

If you use Facebook, here is a link to the event:

Also, my colleague Jessica and I have been hooking up other waves with work experience opportunities in stuff that interests them, skills development workshops and charity work. We&apos;ll be there so if you are interested in doing something this summer we can have a chat.

Pls RSVP and share the love (friends from other waves also welcome).
