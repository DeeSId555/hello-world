Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, <br class="blank" />
<br class="blank" />
Thank you for partnering with The Challenge Society to make the event on Saturday 16th February such a success.  We would not be able to run these events and offer these exciting opportunities to young people without your help, dedication and support. We have had lots of encouraging feedback from the young people who attended, so thank you for all your help.

The Challenge Society exists to further support young peopleâ€™s involvement in positive, local activity and volunteering.  Strong relationships  are essential to our success and we want to ensure we are doing everything possible to make your experience of working with us a positive one.
