Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, <br class="blank" />
<br class="blank" />
Thank you for partnering with The Challenge Society yesterday to make FebFest 2013 such a success.We have had lots of encouraging feedback from the young people who attended who were very excited about the 'brilliant opportunities' on offer and 'signing up to make a difference in their community'. We will be working hard to try and support the young people that expressed an interest to get involved with your organisation and would love to hear from you about this too! When you have a moment it would be greatly appreciated if you could scan over the sign up sheets please.

The Challenge Society exists to further support young peopleâ€™s involvement in positive, local activity and volunteering.  Strong relationships with community partners like yourselves are essential to our success and we want to ensure we are doing everything possible to make your experience of working with us a positive one.
