Dear <NAME>,

If you need to take time away from the Challenge programme, you will have to fill in an absence request form which I have attached to this email. If you print this out and either scan it/post it back to us, we can try to arrange your absence from the programme. You will need to arrange your own transportation to and from your other commitment. 

If it is not possible to grant an absence, due to the specific date being important, or you needing more than a reasonable amount of time away, we can try to arrange an alternative start-date for the programme you attend. If this is preferable, please arrange for a parent or guardian to contact us with your preferred date.

I hope this was helpful, please don't hesitate to contact us if you have further questions on 0203 542 2400.

Regards,
