Dear <NAME>,

You can change your date for the Challenge programme, provided we still have space on your preferred date. To make a change though, we do need parental/guardian's consent. The best thing to do would be to get your parent/guardian to contact us by phone or email to allow us to make the change for you. 

Please ask them to do this as soon as possible so that there are more likely to be places available on the programmes, as our spaces are almost full. If there is no space on a date you can always elect to join a waiting list for that programme, this would allow you to fill up a previously filled space which could become available before the start-date as people drop out. There would not be a guarantee that you'd get a space if you joined a waiting list so please think carefully before deciding to change your date.
 
If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact our office on 0203 542 2400.

Regards,
