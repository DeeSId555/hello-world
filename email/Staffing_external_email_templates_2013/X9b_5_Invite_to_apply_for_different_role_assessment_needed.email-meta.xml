Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Many thanks for all of your work for NCS with The Challenge. Following the feedback received on your performance, we would like to invite you to apply for the role of {!Job_Application__c.Recommendation_for_next_year__c} for 2014.


We feel that it is important to continue to improve our roles year on year; and in order to improve the quality of our programme, changes have been made to some of the roles so we will require an assessment for you to apply for this position.*


Please follow the link and complete an application form fully and put in any information that would be relevant to that role. An assessment date will be sent to you in due course.
