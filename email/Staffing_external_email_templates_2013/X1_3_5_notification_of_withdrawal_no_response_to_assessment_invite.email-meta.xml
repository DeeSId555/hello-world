Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We do not appear to have received any response from you in respect to our invitation to select an assessment date.

If we do not hear from you in 7 working days your application will be moved to our dormant applications file.

If you wish to reactivate your application please select an assessment date by accessing the link below and email me so that I can reactivate your application if places still remain available in your area.

Please click on the button below to choose your preferred assessment date and time.

Thank you for your interest in NCS with The Challenge.
