Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for applying for a role on our NCS with The Challenge programme.

Unfortunately, we will not be taking your application further. We have received a great many applications and the quality has been very high this year.

Unfortunately due to the scale of our recruitment we cannot provide feedback at this stage.

Thank you for your interest in NCS with The Challenge.


Best Wishes,

NCS with The Challenge
