Applications to work on NCS with The Challenge (www.ncsthechallenge.org), a residential and community programme motivating young people, in summer 2014 are now open.

We are looking for dynamic and inspiring staff to motivate teams of 16 and 17-year-olds from London, West Midlands and the North West. There are three parts to the programme: residential outdoor expedition (including abseiling and canoeing), team challenge (drama, enterprise, sport, media, photography) and projects designed by the young people themselves.

This is a chance to work on an intense, exciting youth programme inspiring teams of young people. There is a range of summer roles available, both for paid staff and volunteers, from between two and fourteen weeks, between June and September.

If you think that might be of interest at all, you can get more information about the opportunities and apply at www.ncsthechallenge.org/jobs.

Best wishes,
