Dear {!Contact.Name},


The NCS with The Challenge Autumn programme is nearly here and we hope you are looking forward to it as much as we are!


As you may be aware, the autumn programme is slightly different to the summer programme - largely in its structure, staffing requirements and length.


Please read through this short document, which highlights the differences between the programmes, before you start your role so that you can raise any questions you have with your teams before the programme begins.

For more information please contact your local staffing representative quoting the email reference number in any correspondence.


Kind regards,


NCS with The Challenge
