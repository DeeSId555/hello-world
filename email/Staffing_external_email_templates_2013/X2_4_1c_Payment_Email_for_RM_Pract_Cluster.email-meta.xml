· Waves 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 will have an advance. A wave that is advanced is paid on the specified advance date as listed above. This advance will be 70% of the gross pay for a specified ‘wave’. Gross pay refers to the amount of salary that is paid to you for each wave you complete before any deductions of any type (Tax and NI) are made from the pay.

· The remaining 30% of the gross pay for this specified wave will be paid on the ‘Pay Date’ with Tax and NI deductions made from this payment. Depending on your tax situation, this payment could be a very small amount.


This payment structure has two principles: (a) to ensure that staff members pay the appropriate level of tax in the correct month and (b) to enable staff members to receive payment in reasonable time.



Yours sincerely,


NCS with The Challenge
