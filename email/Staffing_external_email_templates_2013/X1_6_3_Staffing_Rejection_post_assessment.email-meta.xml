Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for attending the assessment at NCS with The Challenge. Unfortunately, we will not be taking your application further.

Competition for places was very strong and successful candidates demonstrated an impressive level of experience and suitability for our intensive youth programme.

Unfortunately, due to the high volumes of applications we receive, we are unable to give individual feed back.

We appreciate you taking the time to apply to work with us and thank you for your interest in NCS with The Challenge.

Best wishes,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
