Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Congratulations on being appointed to work on NCS with The Challenge. We hope you are excited about your wave and looking forward to meeting the young people you will be supporting.

You should have received your contract and timetable, either via the staffing website or via email. However, we have noticed you have not yet responded to the contract.  You must submit a response before starting your wave, it is a requirement before starting your role.

Please submit a response to all contracts within 24 hours of receiving this notice.

If you feel you are missing your contract please contact your Staffing Associate.

Many thanks for your assistance.
