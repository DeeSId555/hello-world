    <subject>Re: Your assessment with The Challenge</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for coming to your assessment with The Challenge.
We were very impressed by your performance and are pleased to tell you that you achieved the standard of the {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c} role.

Unfortunately, there are currently no available slots for that role this summer, so we would like to place you on the back-up staff list and invite you to one-day back-up training. This means we cannot guarantee you a job offer, but we will contact you as and when staff withdraw from or become otherwise unavailable for the role. Last year, almost all candidates on the back-up staff list were offered a full role later in the summer.

Please click on the button below to complete this process.
