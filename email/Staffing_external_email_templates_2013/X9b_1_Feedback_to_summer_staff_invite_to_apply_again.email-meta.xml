Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Many thanks for your contribution to NCS with The Challenge. Following the feedback received on your performance, we would like to invite you to re-apply for the same role of {!Job_Application__c.Recommendation_for_next_year__c} for 2014.


We feel that it is important to continue to improve our roles year on year; and in order to improve the quality of our programme, changes have been made to some of the roles so we will require a re-assessment for you to apply for this position.
