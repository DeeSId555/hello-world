Dear {!Contact.FirstName}



Thank you for taking the time to apply to work on NCS with The Challenge this Autumn. The majority of our paid roles are currently full so we are not reviewing all applications.



We are currently only recruiting for the Practitioner roles during our Autumn Programme. If we feel you are suitable for the Practitioner role we will contact you to take the process further.


Thank you for your interest in NCS with The Challenge.




Best wishes,
