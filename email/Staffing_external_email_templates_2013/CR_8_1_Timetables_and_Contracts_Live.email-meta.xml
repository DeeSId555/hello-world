Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Hope you have enjoyed the summer so far and you are looking forward to working on NCS with The Challenge programme.

The ‘My Role’ section in the Programme Stage of the Staffing website is now available. In this section you can view:-

- Timetables and contracts for your work assignment or multiple assignments if you are working all summer long.

- Role guides and materials to help you with your role.

Click here to go the Staffing Website
https://staffing.the-challenge.org/secure/

What do you need to do?

Once you login to the website you can see a summary of all the assignments you will be working. Each work assignment has a different timetable and contract. You will need to submit a response to each and every contract, reading the terms and conditions carefully before you do. Contracts and timetables can be downloaded and printed at your leisure.

Please ensure that you login the day before you begin your role as we communicate timetable changes via the Staffing Website. If you do not check at this time you could go to the wrong location.

Additional sections will be made available at a later stage.

We hope you are excited about your role and we will be in touch soon!
Best Wishes,



NCS with The Challenge
