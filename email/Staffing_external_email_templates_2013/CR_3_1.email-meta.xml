Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Congratulations again on being offered a role to work for NCS with the Challenge.

We are rolling out our new website and the first phase is now ready to use. The new website will allow you to manage your information more easily and submit all the necessary information needed before starting your role.

Phase 1 of the website is about your work preferences; choosing when you can work and listing any dates when you cannot work. Please complete this section with all your availability from June to September even if you have already spoken to your Staffing Associate. We will be unable to complete your work placements without it.

There will be a number of sections that are unavailable on the website and we will contact you shortly when they are ready to use.

Please find your login details below:-
