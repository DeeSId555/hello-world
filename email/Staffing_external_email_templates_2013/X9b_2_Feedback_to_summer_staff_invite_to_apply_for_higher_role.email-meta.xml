Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Many thanks for your contribution to NCS with The Challenge. Following the feedback received on your performance, we would like to invite you to apply for the role of {!Job_Application__c.Recommendation_for_next_year__c} for 2014.


Please follow the link and complete an application form. An assessment date will be sent to you in due course.


N.B. if you would prefer to work in the same role as last year, we would welcome you back without an assessment.



All returning staff must complete the new style application form for data purposes and to open a new profile for the year. Please take this opportunity to add any new experience to your application.


Please follow the link below to complete the application form, if you are applying for a different role an invitation for assessment will be sent to you in due course.*
