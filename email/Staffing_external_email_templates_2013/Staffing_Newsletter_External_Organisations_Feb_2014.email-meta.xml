NCS WITH THE CHALLENGE - FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE

NCS with The Challenge brings together 15-17 year olds from different backgrounds, builds their confidence, and inspires them to make a difference in their local community.

The young people take part in a three week summer scheme:

Get Active
Teams overcome fears, create friendships and build confidence through intense outdoor activities like gorge-walking and rafting.

Get Involved
Teams return home to learn a new skill (drama, enterprise, media, photography, music and sport) and use it as a way to interact with their community.

Make Your Mark
Teams design a campaign on a community issue and pitch their plans to a panel of &apos;dragons&apos; for project funding and advice.

Over 4 September weekends teams deliver their campaign and other social action projects.
