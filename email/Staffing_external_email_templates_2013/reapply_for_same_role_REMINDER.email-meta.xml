    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you are well.

We are looking forward to the upcoming summer programme here in the office, and hope that you will be able to join us again!

This is a reminder to invite you to return to the same role, as a Support Worker. As you have worked for The Challenge last year there will not be a requirement for you to attend an assessment; although there will be some training again this year on the 8th of June.

You will need to fill in an application form for data purposes, indicating you are a returner for same role. Following this, you will be contacted regularly for updates on the progress of the support worker matches leading up to the summer when once again the role will be matched to the support needs of a young person.

If you want to apply for another role please complete the application fully and put in any information that would be relevant to that role. Your application will then be considered alongside all other applications and for this you will need to attend both the assessment for the role, and if considered suitable all relevant training days.

Please follow this link to create your 2014 profile; the application is slightly different this year.
If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

This is the second of three reminders; I don&apos;t want to bombard you with too many but also don&apos;t want you to forget!

If you no longer wish to be contacted please let me know.

Warm Regards,

Sherry Kimball
