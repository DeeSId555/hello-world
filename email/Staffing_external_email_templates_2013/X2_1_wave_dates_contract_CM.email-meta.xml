Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact__c}

1.I am pleased to be able to offer you a contract of employment with The Challenge Network, which is part of the National Citizen Service programme. Each Wave Contract and each Weekend Contract is a separate employment contract. Each contract is for a fixed term and the beginning and end dates for each fixed term is set out below:

Real Challenge Design from {!Job_placement__c.RCD_KO_date__c} to {!Job_placement__c.RCD_End_date__c} (&quot;Work Period&quot;) plus {!Job_placement__c.Annual_Leave_entitlement__c}days (&quot;Holiday Period&quot;)];
(a &quot;Wave Contract&quot;),

and:

Real Challenge Action Day 1 on 16/11/2013,
Real Challenge Action Day 2 on 23/11/2013   (&quot;Work Period&quot;) plus {!Job_placement__c.Annual_Leave_entitlement__c}days (&quot;Holiday Period&quot;)];
(a  &quot;Weekend Contract&quot;)

2. Although each Wave Contract and each Weekend Contract is a separate contract of employment, please note that if you accept a Wave Contract you must also accept the corresponding Weekend Contract. Similarly you cannot just accept a Weekend Contract without accepting the corresponding Wave Contract.  Therefore the offer of the Wave Contract is conditional on your acceptance of the corresponding Weekend Contracts and vice versa, unless specifically agreed otherwise.

3.Each employment contract (whether a Wave Contract or a Weekend Contract) is made up from the applicable parts of this email, and The Challenge Network Terms of Employment attached to this email.

4.Please note that the Work Period of your contract(s) will be the only time that you will be required to report for work.  The Holiday Period of the contract(s) is when you will be expected to take holiday leave.  For more information on holiday, please see The Challenge Network Terms of Employment.

5.You cannot start any employment contract with TCN until you have completed the necessary pre employment training applicable to that contract, details of which will be sent to you separately.

6.Your role will be {!Job_placement__c.Role__c}.

7.Your payment rates and the date of payment for each contract is set out in the  Payment Schedule that will be sent to you separately.
Your place of work will be as set out in the Where to be When Guide (‘WWG’). The log in to this portal will be sent to you separately.

8.Details of your duties are set out in the Role Guide and who you report to (your &quot;Reporting Manager&quot;) will be communicated to you prior to the commencement of your role.

9.Your employment cannot commence until we have received (1) two satisfactory references and an enhanced DBS check; (2) a copy of the enclosed terms confirming your acceptance of each contract; and (3) satisfactory evidence that you are not prohibited from working in the UK.  Please see the checklist attached to this email for details of what constitutes satisfactory evidence.  If you fail to do so you will be unable to commence employment.  If this is problematic please contact me for further options.

If you are interested in working with The Challenge Network but do not wish to accept the contract(s) because you want to explore different work schedules please click on the &quot;No, I would like to change my work schedule&quot; button.
