Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I am writing to inform you that you have been entered into the workplace pension scheme. This is new legislation which the government has introduced this year - it is a way of saving for your retirement that&apos;s arranged by your employer. For further information about the scheme, please go to www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions

All staff are entered into the pension scheme if they fulfill the criteria for auto-enrollment. For a full list of criteria please refer to the Staffing Website FAQ 7.3.

Further details, including amounts deducted, customer reference numbers and how to opt-out, will be communicated to you within the next few days along with your payslip.

If you have any queries about any of the above please email our recruitment support team on staffing.support@the-challenge.org  quoting the email reference number in any correspondence.

We hope you have enjoyed your time on the NCS with The Challenge summer programme.


Best wishes,


NCS with The Challenge
