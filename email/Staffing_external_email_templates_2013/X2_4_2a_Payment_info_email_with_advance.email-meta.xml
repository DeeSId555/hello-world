Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

Congratulations on being appointed as {!Job_placement__c.Role__c} on NCS with The Challenge this summer on {!Job_placement__c.Wave__c}.

Your total pay for this part of the role will be {!Job_placement__c.Total_gross_pay__c}, this includes pay for  {!Job_placement__c.Annual_Leave_entitlement__c} day(s), &quot;Holiday Period&quot;; per &quot;Wave Contract&quot;, which is subject to tax and national insurance deductions. We reserve the right to deduct pay for any unauthorised absences. This payment will cover the following parts of the programme -  NCS: Personal Challenge, NCS: Team Challenge and NCS: Real Challenge Design (one or more will be relevant to your role). Payments for NCS: The Real Challenge Action will be communicated to you at a later date once you have completed them.

Your payment structure for this wave is based on the principal that no one should wait longer than 5 weeks after they have completed their wave for payment therefore:-

1. 70% of the gross pay will be paid on {!Job_placement__c.Advance_payment_date__c}.
(NB: Gross pay refers to the amount of salary that is paid to you for each wave you complete before any deductions (Tax and NI) are taken from the pay).

2. The remaining 30% of your gross pay will be paid on {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_payment_date__c} with Tax and NI deductions made from this payment.

Depending on your tax situation, this payment could be a very small amount.

You will receive a separate payment email for each wave you complete.

You will receive further information about your pay relating to the NCS Real Challenge Action weekends and Graduation (if applicable) in due course.

This payment structure has two principles: (a) to ensure that staff members pay the appropriate level of tax in the correct month and (b) to enable staff members to receive timely payment.

Yours sincerely,


NCS with The Challenge
