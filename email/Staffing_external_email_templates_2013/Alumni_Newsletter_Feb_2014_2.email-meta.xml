New Staffing Website launch

We have a great new Staffing Website launching  this month; this will be the place where you manage and amend your  information, work preferences and in due course complete other processes like  expenses.

As we are rolling out our new system we will endeavour to make it as smooth as possible, we thank you in advance for your patience.

Applicants who are offered a role will receive login details soon and in the first phase you will be asked to submit your work preferences. Please help us by doing this even if you  have already spoken to your Staffing Associate and confirmed dates over the  phone.

The Essentials, what do you need to  know?
Each year NCS with The Challenge grows. We are  hoping to have over 18,000 young people on the Programme in the summer, employing over 2,500 staff to support our young people. If you have not yet applied and would like to work with us again, please fill out an application.

Each and every single staff member needs to have a  DBS before working on the program. Last year several members of staff could not work the wave they were allocated because their DBS was not back  in time. So, get all your paper work done as early as possible and don’t miss  out.  Remember, there is a new  requirement this year: we need to witness your DBS document along with proof of  identity at training, so be sure to bring everything with you. We will remind  you again nearer the time. If you have any queries, please contact your local staffing representative.

Take A Chance

Chance UK aims to improve the  lives of primary school children with behavioural difficulties who are at risk  of developing anti-social or criminal behaviour in the future. We achieve this by  providing tailored one-to-one mentoring to help raise children&apos;s self-esteem  via a range of activities.

They need  mentors aged 18+ to work a minimum of 2- 4 hours a week over a period of 12  months working with a child from one of the following boroughs; Hackney,  Islington, Lambeth, Waltham Forest or Enfield.

No  experience necessary; this is a great opportunity for anyone interested in  developing their skills or becoming more involved in their local community.
Take a chance and find out more information here!

Did you know?

44% of London pupils have received  private tuition; another inequality that is exacerbating the link between  income and academic achievement.

Action Tutoring are working to tackle this imbalance by providing  tuition to pupils who could not otherwise afford it. They work in partnership  with schools across the UK and run programs across the nation.

They need volunteers who can tutor  pupils for just an hour a week for up to 8 weeks. If you want to make a big  difference to young people and their future life opportunities, find out more and apply now.

Pop-Up Talent - Boosting Employability of 16-25 year olds

The Foyer Federation, in partnership with Changemakers and Good People, are offering a modern twist on how and where  young people connect with employers. Using new spaces and conversations, young  people will be able to build their skills, attitudes and networks to find and  create work in the 21st century.

Pop-Up Talent Shops bring local young people  face-to-face with local employers, develop confidence and run taster sessions  in a relaxed atmosphere. Further activities involve a social action project and digital tasks based around employability, and developing new and existing skills.

Help tackle unemployment in Birmingham, London &amp; Wales; pass on this information to others who would benefit or come along  to a Pop-Up Talent shop near you.
