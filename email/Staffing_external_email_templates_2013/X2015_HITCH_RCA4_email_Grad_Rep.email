Hi guys!

This weekend is the last weekend of NCS - and it's VOLUNTEER DAY! 

Not only are you going to be part of amazing, positive social action in your community and supporting your partner charity, but you will also be gaining a whole host of skills, in real-life settings (these examples look great on CV's and in interviews!). 

It is really super important that your whole team are present (and on time!). 

.... It is also the last time before Graduation that you will be together as a wave! 


​

Please remember to raise money for you charity. You will be working closely with them this weekend so it would be amazing for you to be able to tell them how much money you have raised as a group. Any amount of money would be hugely helpful to your charity - so get out there and ask your friends, family and neighbours to sponsor you and you can find the Sponsorship forms  attached, please share this with your teams for final collections.


You can also refer them to your Mydonate Page which will close on the 2nd of October!
 Please find your teams specific Mydonate URL in the word document attached below. 


Remember every £1 of sponsorship money you raise = 1 Nandos Point, so get collecting to win that amazing Nandos Prize!🍟


We look forward to seeing you this weekend! 

🙌Everyone at NCS! 🙌
