I hope that you have had a great summer with NCS The Challenge.

We are now fast approaching the Real Challenge Action taking place over the September weekends.

If you are still yet to receive this email, please respond as soon as you receive it.

Furthermore, if you are available to work additional dates, please let us know if you would like to be considered for cover.

Thank you for your hard work which has helped to make the programmes such a success.

Kind Regards,
