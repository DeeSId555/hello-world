Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

I hope you have enjoyed your placement on NCS with The Challenge on one of our pilot programmes.

This payment email is regarding your work on NCS: Real Challenge Action. You will receive up to four emails in total, each corresponding to a specific NCS: Real Challenge Action day.

Your payment for completing the NCS: Real Challenge Action day on
on {!Job_placement__c.Assignment_start_date__c} for {!Job_placement__c.Wave__c} is outlined below.

Your payment for the specified work date will be split into two payments. The standard gross pay for completing a full working day is {!Job_placement__c.Total_Amount_to_Pay__c}. You will receive an initial payment of 70% of the gross pay for the specified NCS: Real Challenge Action day on {!Job_placement__c.Advance_payment_date__c}. This payment is an advance and thus will not be subjected to Tax and National Insurance. You will receive {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_advance_owed__c} on this advance date.

The remaining 30% gross pay for the specified NCS: Real Challenge Action day will be subject to Tax and National Insurance and will be received on {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_payment_date__c}.

The overall amount which you receive on {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_payment_date__c} will vary according to your tax code, but will be significantly smaller than your first payment for this role, and may be close to zero.

On your payslip (sent via email on {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_payment_date__c}) , you will see the total amount and breakdown of payment which you will receive for the entire wave.

Due to new auto-enrolment legislation, employees of The Challenge, including summer staff, will be automatically enrolled in a workplace pension scheme. This is a way of saving for your retirement that&apos;s arranged by your employer. This affects staff who earn more than Â£473 per month and are aged between 22 and state pension age. You will see your pension contributions on your payslip. For further information, please go to www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions.

Further communications, including how to opt out, will be sent to you in September where we will start to process all summer staff for auto-enrolment. At that point, if you would like to opt out of the pension scheme, you will need an opt-out form from The People&apos;s Pension, which you can get from and then return to by emailing thepeoplespension@bandce.co.uk. Staff will have a one month opt-out period: this begins from the day the administration for their becoming a member is complete, i.e. one month from the date of enrolment, which will not take place until September.

If you have any questions, do contact us.

Yours sincerely,

NCS with The Challenge
