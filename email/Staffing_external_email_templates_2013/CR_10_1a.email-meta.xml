Thank you for applying to work on NCS with The Challenge. Unfortunately, we had a large number of applications for the summer 2014 programme, and most of our roles were full when you applied. Therefore we were unable to consider your application for this year’s programme.

Alternatively, we have a volunteer opportunity available during September on NCS with The Challenge.

Project Volunteer

As a project volunteer you would be helping a team of young people deliver campaigns and fundraising projects in September 2014 to strengthen their community in London, Surrey, West Midlands or North-West England.


Why should you apply now?
• A chance to make a difference
• Gain experience working with young people
• Great for your CV
• Many volunteers continue to work on our later programmes in a paid capacity

If you are interested you do not need to apply again - just email summer2014@the-challenge.org and we can tell you more about the role!

If the above opportunity does not work with you current situation, we would also welcome your application for a 2015 summer role; our applications open in December so please apply early!

Best wishes
