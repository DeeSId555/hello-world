    <textOnly>Volunteer: NCS with The Challenge

Use your mentoring skills to inspire young people

NCS with The Challenge is looking for motivating and responsible Project Volunteers to help a team of twelve young people deliver campaigns and fundraising projects in September 2014 to strengthen their community in London, Surrey, West Midlands or North West England.

What is NCS with The Challenge?
NCS with The Challenge is a life-changing experience for 16 and 17-year-olds. The scheme is available to people from all backgrounds. Young people get the chance to do outdoor activities, meet new people and give something back to their communities.

What will you be doing?
Project Volunteers spend four Saturdays or four Sundays in September 2014 as their teams deliver projects to bring their communities together. We are looking for volunteers who will build rapport with young people and inspire them to carry out their projects.

Why should you sign up?
• Gain experience working with young people which is great for your CV

• Many volunteers continue to work on our later programmes in a paid capacity

• A chance to make a difference

All volunteers will attend a three-hour training session for this role and all reasonable travel expenses will be covered.
