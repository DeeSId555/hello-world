Dear {!HR_Event_Attendance__c.Candidate_Name__c},

Thank you for booking onto your assessment,

{!HR_Event__c.Date_time_location__c}

In preparation for the assessment please:

- Prepare two icebreaker games/exercises to share with the group. The ice breakers need to be no more than 2 minutes long and for a group size of 12.
- Wear smart/casual comfortable clothing and appropriate footwear as there will be various group activities to undertake.
- It is good to eat lunch before you come as there will only be a short break mid-afternoon with drinks and biscuits.
-Due to the nature of the assessment it is difficult to admit late comers. If you are late it will be at our discretion if you are allowed to join the assessment on that day.
- However, if you arrive very early we may have to ask you to wait outside due to space constraints at the venue.

We look forward to meeting you!

Best wishes,
