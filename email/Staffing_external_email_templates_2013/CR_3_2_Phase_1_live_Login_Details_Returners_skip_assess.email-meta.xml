Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for returning to work on NCS with The Challenge.

We are rolling out our new website and the first phase is now ready to use. The new website will allow you to manage your information more easily and submit all the necessary information needed before starting your role.

This phase of the website is about your work preferences; choosing when you can work and listing any dates when you cannot work. Please complete this section with all your availability from June to September even if you have already spoken to your Staffing Associate. We will be unable to complete your work placements without it. We will also use this information to contact you about additional work dates if appropriate.

Please find your login details below:-

Username: {!Contact.Email}
Password: {!Contact.Login_Password__c}

Click here to go to the Web site

There will be a number of sections that are unavailable on the website and we will contact you shortly when the next phase is ready.

Once you have logged in, please click on My profile. At the bottom of your profile there is an option to update your password. Please click here and change your password.

Essential Information is being processed- if you have not done so already, please continue to submit this information as per your job offer email.
