Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

It is possible that you will incur expenses during your assignment with NCS with The Challenge.



We will only authorise expenses for essential travel during the programme. This does not cover your travel to or from your place of residence and NCS with The Challenge venues. Our Expenses Policy only covers &apos;other&apos; expenses in exceptional circumstances. Ensure you keep all receipts for any expense you incur as we will be unable to repay any expenses without receipts.



Expenses Form
http://www.clicktools.com/survey?iv=1x0lrts1bnxq1&amp;q1={!Job_Application__c.Id}&amp;q2={!Job_placement__c.Id}


Please read the instructions carefully:



Expenses will be paid to you on a fortnightly basis and need to be submitted by the first and third Sunday of the month to avoid delays to repayment.



How do I claim expenses?



Please follow these steps:

Scan or photograph your receipts from the summer.
Number the scans/photographs to correspond to the items on the form.
Itemise your expenses and upload scans or photographs of your receipts on the online form.
Submit the form
Please also send your receipts to programme.expenses@the-challenge.org
Ensure that you retain all receipts until you have been paid your expenses.

You can submit the form as many times as you need to fit all your expenses per wave.



We can only accept scanned or clearly photographed receipts. Paper receipts handed in or posted will not be processed.



We encourage you to submit your expenses regularly - on a weekly basis where possible. This will help to ensure you are reimbursed as quickly as possible.



Your claim will be authorised if everything is completed correctly and falls within our expenses policy. We will aim to pay all expenses directly into your bank account within two weeks of receiving your claim.



The deadline for the submission of autumn expenses is 10th December 2014. Any expenses submitted after this date will not be paid.



If you have any questions please contact your local staffing representative quoting the email reference number in any correspondence.




Best wishes,



NCS with The Challenge
