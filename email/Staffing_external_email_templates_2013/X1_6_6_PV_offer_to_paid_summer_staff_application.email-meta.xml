Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Following your assessment at The Challenge we are unable to offer you a paid role but feel you would be ideally suited to the role of {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c} and hope you feel able to accept.



This role will allow you to gain experience working with young people that could lead to paid employment in the future.



This offer is conditional on the completion of a satisfactory DBS, your availability and the receipt of further information required to arrange a job placement for you.



We will contact you at the end of April to gather your interest and other information from you.



Thanks you for your support and we hope to see you again soon.



Best wishes,


{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
