Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

We hope you are having a great summer. We are contacting you to give you more details about the Project Volunteer role you were offered at NCS with The Challenge this summer.  We offer these roles to people who we feel have the potential to take on one of our paid roles once they have acquired more experience or knowledge of NCS.

So what is the Project Volunteer role?

As a Project Volunteer you will help a team of twelve young people deliver campaigns and fundraising projects in order to strengthen their community in London, Surrey, the West Midlands or North West England. You will spend four Saturdays or four Sundays in September volunteering with the teams as they deliver projects to bring their communities together.

‘I&apos;m interested’

If you have already been offered this role we will be contacting you shortly to complete all the necessary arrangements.

If you have not received an offer you will be able to apply through our website shortly

If you have any additional questions about the role please contact us on summer2014@the-challenge.org with the subject line ‘Project Volunteer role’ and we will contact you. Many of our Project Volunteers go on to secure paid roles on our autumn and summer programmes.

‘I&apos;m not interested’

If you do not wish to receive any more communication about the role, we can withdraw your application. Please contact us on summer2014@the-challenge.org with the subject line ‘Withdraw from Project Volunteer role’.

We look forward to hearing from you
