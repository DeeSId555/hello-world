Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

If you have loved working on NCS with The Challenge in a seasonal role then think about working for us all year round!

We are currently looking for new core staff to work in our central and regional offices.

Roles we would particularly like to promote are:-

NCS Sales Coordinator - if you loved working with the young people this could be ideal for you. We are looking for people in London and Birmingham.
Curriculum Associate - if you would like to help plan the NCS the Challenge programme this role would be great for you.

All our year-round roles are advertised at www.the-challenge.org/year-round-roles. Please go to the role that is of interest, and apply to the appropriate contact.

Many thanks for all your work with NCS with The Challenge.
