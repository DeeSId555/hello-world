Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

I am writing to ask you if you could possibly check your When to be Where document on the staff section of The Challenge website. Visit the Staffing website using the details below.

Website: http://staff.the-challenge.org/
Username: {!Job_placement__c.Contact_email__c}
Login pin: {!Job_placement__c.Staffing_website_login_PIN__c}

Occasionally, unavoidable changes are made to the staff schedules, and so we would encourage you to check again before your role starts. If any changes are made after this point, we will contact you directly. You will receive a phone call from your Assistant Programme Manager shortly before starting to confirm details.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on the below address.

Best wishes,

{!Job_placement__c.Staffing_Associate__c}
