Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

Many thanks for taking on the role of {!Job_placement__c.Role__c} on the NCS: Real Challenge Action (RCA) and (if applicable) NCS: Graduations days.

Your total gross pay for your work on {!Job_placement__c.Assignment_end_date__c} will be {!Job_placement__c.Total_gross_pay__c}. This will be subject to tax and NI deductions.

When will I receive this payment?

The table below outlines when each RCA day will be paid.

NCS: Real Challenge Action (RCA)

RCA1 : Sat 6-Sep 2014, Sun 7-Sep 2014 PAYROLL DATE 23-Sep 2014

RCA2: Sat 13-Sep 2014, Sun 14-Sep 2014 PAYROLL DATE 23-Sep 2014

On your payslip (sent via email on {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_payment_date__c}), you will see the total amount which you will receive. 

Due to new auto-enrolment legislation, employees of The Challenge, including summer staff, will be automatically enrolled in a workplace pension scheme. This is a way of saving for your retirement that&apos;s arranged by your employer. This affects staff who earn more than Â£473 per month and are aged between 22 and state pension age. You will see your pension contributions on your payslip. For further information, please go to www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions. 

Further communications, including how to opt out, will be sent to you in September where we will start to process all summer staff for auto-enrolment. At that point, if you would like to opt out of the pension scheme, you will need an opt-out form from The People&apos;s Pension, which you can get from and then return to by emailing thepeoplespension@bandce.co.uk. Staff will have a one month opt-out period: this begins from the day the administration for their becoming a member is complete, i.e. one month from the date of enrolment, which will not take place until September.

If you have any questions, do let us know.

We very much hope you enjoyed working on NCS with The Challenge.

Yours sincerely,

{!Job_placement__c.Staffing_Associate__c}
