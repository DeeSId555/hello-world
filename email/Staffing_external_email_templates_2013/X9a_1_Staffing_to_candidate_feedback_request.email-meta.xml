Dear {!Contact.FirstName}



Let us know your thoughts on NCS with The Challenge


We recently wrote to you asking if you could fill in a survey of your experience on NCS with The Challenge programme. We would be very grateful if you would take the time to do this, so that we can evaluate the programme and take your suggestions on board.

All feedback we get will form part of our complete review of all processes, and will inform how we work in 2015.


Please click on the link to start the survey: Feedback Form

Many thanks if you have already completed a short questionnaire from us, however we would really appreciate you completing this one as well.


Final deadline for submission is 24th October 2014.



This is your chance to let us know your feedback on NCS with The Challenge. We look forward to reading it!
