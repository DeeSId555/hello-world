Thank you for your feedback
In October, we asked all our summer staff to give us feedback about their experience of working with us. It is important for us to continually improve and reflect on how the programme turned out. It was absolutely fantastic to read what you had to say.

All staff who submitted feedback were entered into a prize draw. The winners from our competition received Amazon vouchers; the winners were Alison Avery from Surrey, Joanna Darrington from South London, Naomi Thompson from North London and Kurt Cook from the West Midlands.

Congratulations  to our winners!

Season’s  Greetings and a Happy New Year
