Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for all of your hard work over the summer; we hope that you have enjoyed working as a Practitioner on the programme. Your contribution has been invaluable.

If you would like to continue to work for NCS with The Challenge we are looking for people with availability throughout September weekends to undertake the Community Facilitator role.

As a Community Facilitator (CF), you will spend up to four weekends in September supporting the teams of young people as they complete the Community project which they designed over the summer. It is a great opportunity to see the young people complete the final part of the programme.

This is a non-residential role, available across all Greater London boroughs and Surrey. 

If you are available in this opportunity, please register your interest for the role below.
