Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for your application to work for NCS with The Challenge.



You stated that you have a current DBS but unfortunately we have either



a) Not received a copy of your DBS (formerly named CRB).

b) Or the DBS that you have sent through was unreadable or incomplete.



Please either scan or photograph your whole DBS document and send it to staffing.support@the-challenge.org



NB. You will need to take a picture of the whole document and take two close ups - please ensure that that the photographs are as clear as possible.



Once we have received this and confirmed its validity we will be in touch.



Thank you for your interest in NCS with The Challenge.


Best wishes,


Staffing Department

The Challenge
