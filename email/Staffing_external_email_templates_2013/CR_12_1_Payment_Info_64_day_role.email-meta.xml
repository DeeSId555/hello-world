Pension



Due to new auto-enrolment legislation, employees of The Challenge, including summer staff, will be automatically enrolled in a workplace pension scheme. This is a way of saving for your retirement that&apos;s arranged by your employer. This affects staff who earn more than £473 per month and are aged between 22 and state pension age. You will see your pension contributions on your payslip. For further information, please go to www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions.



Further communications, including how to opt out, will be sent to you in September where we will start to process all summer staff for auto-enrolment. At that point, if you would like to opt out of the pension scheme, you will need an opt-out form from The People&apos;s Pension, which you can get from and then return to by emailing thepeoplespension@bandce.co.uk. Staff will have a one month opt-out period: this begins from the day the administration for their becoming a member is complete, i.e. one month from the date of enrolment, which will not take place until September.



Any questions let us know!
Best Wishes,
