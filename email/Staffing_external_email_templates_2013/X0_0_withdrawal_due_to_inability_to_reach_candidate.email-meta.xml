    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

I have tried to contact you on numerous occasions by telephone and by email in order to further your application to The Challenge.

Due to the fact that I have been unable to reach you, I am writing to you to inform you that we have withdrawn you from the application process.

If this is an error, please contact me using the contact details below and I will reopen your application.

Thank you for your interest in The Challenge.

Best wishes,
