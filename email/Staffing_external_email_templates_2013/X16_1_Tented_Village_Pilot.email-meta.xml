Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Many thanks for your contribution to the NCS with The Challenge programme.

We&apos;re getting in touch because as part of delivering NCS with The Challenge this summer you stayed residentially at our Tented Village in Lambourne End. This year was the first that The Challenge have run accommodation like this, and we are keen to hear about your experience staying under canvas.

The pilot is crucial if the programme is to continue expanding and working with ever greater numbers of young people across London and your feedback will help us to make it an increasingly successful residential experience.

We will be sending out a survey to all our staff at the end of September about your experience working with us as a whole but ask that you fill in both surveys as your feed back is really important to us in developing our programme and making it an even better experience for the Staff and young people who take part.

Please take 2 minutes to fill out the survey, we would really appreciate it!

Many thanks,
