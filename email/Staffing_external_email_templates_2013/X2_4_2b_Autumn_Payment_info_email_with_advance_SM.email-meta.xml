Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

Congratulations on being appointed as {!Job_placement__c.Role__c} with The Challenge Network this summer on {!Job_placement__c.Wave__c}.

Your total pay for this role will be {!Job_placement__c.Total_gross_pay__c}, which is subject to tax and national insurance deductions.

Your payment structure for this wave will be:

70% of the gross pay will be paid on {!Job_placement__c.Advance_payment_date__c}

The remainder of your gross paid will be paid on {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_payment_date__c}. Tax and NI deductions will happen from this payment.

This payment structure has two principles: (a) to ensure that staff members pay the appropriate level of tax in the correct month and (b) to enable staff members to receive payment.

Yours sincerely,

{!Job_placement__c.Staffing_Associate__c}
The Challenge Network
