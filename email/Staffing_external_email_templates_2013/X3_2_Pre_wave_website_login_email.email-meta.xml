This information is subject to change, and we will let you know if any of the details change prior to your starting.

Occasionally, unavoidable changes are made to the staff schedules, and so we would encourage you to check again before your role starts. If any changes are made after this point, we will contact you directly. You will receive a phone call from your Assistant Programme Manager shortly before starting to confirm details.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on the below address.
