Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for applying for a role at NCS with The Challenge. I am writing to invite you to a group assessment with us.


In your application you indicated that you have a disability that potentially requires adjustment at assessment. Prior to your assessment, we would like to discuss your requirements in more detail with you.


Please call or email me using the details below as soon as possible. We will need at least one week prior to your assessment to ensure we have everything in place.


In the meantime, please click on the button below to register for an assessment.
