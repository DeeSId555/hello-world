Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Many thanks for coming to an assessment at NCS with The Challenge. We consider candidates for a range of roles but I am writing to say that, unfortunately, we are not able to offer you a paid role on NCS with The Challenge this year.

We appreciate that this must be disappointing news for you. However, there are many other ways in which you can continue to stay involved with our work. We can offer you volunteer opportunities on the 2015 programmes such as participating in Youth Boards.

Please do approach us with regard to these other opportunities and we will be able to give you further details.

We are very grateful for your continued interest in our work and we hope that you are able to continue to be involved with us.



Best wishes,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
