Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Based on your performance at the assessment, we would like to offer you the role of {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}.

Congratulations! We look forward to working with you. This offer is conditional on you completing your CRB if you have not already done so, and on being available for the training and work dates offered to you.

You will receive more information by email in the next week. You will be able to book onto the training weekend (8 - 9 June, other dates available in some cases) and tell us which dates you are available to work.

Best wishes,
