Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

We hope you are having a great spring and are looking forward to a fantastic summer working on NCS with the Challenge.

The Essential Information section of our Staffing Website is now available to use. Please log in to the Staffing Website to see what information we now require from you.

Completing this section ensures we have all the necessary information to run a safe programme and pay you for your role. Some sections will contain information you have previously submitted to us, please check these sections to ensure we have the correct information.

All parts of the Essential Information section need to be completed before you can work with us on the program. The Staffing Website FAQs have lots more information if you are unsure about what you need to do.


What do you have to do?


Please log into the staffing website and update all the sections marked &apos;incomplete’.


You can also review some sections marked as ‘submitted’ to check the information is correct.


Any section which says ‘complete’ does not require any further input from you.
