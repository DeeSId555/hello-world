NCS with The Challenge - another fantastic year!

Thanks to your partnership we were able to recruit over 2,500 enthusiastic and motivated staff members for our summer programme. All in all, a massive number of 18 students from Aston University were successful in securing a role with us this summer!

NCS with The Challenge would not be the incredible experience it is for young people, were it not for our summer staff. Your contribution made a real difference.

We wanted to share some comments from the young people about our staff:

&quot;I&apos;ve met some absolutely brill people... Our mentor is one of the best people on the programme&quot;

&quot;Thank you NCS with The Challenge for such a wonderful experience!! It is something I will value and look back on for the rest of my life. Our team mentor, has been amazing... hasn&apos;t just treated us like children.&quot;

Please let us know of any upcoming events and opportunities. We look forward to working with you again in 2015.
