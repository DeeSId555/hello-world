Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

It is possible that you will incur travel expenses during your assignment on NCS with The Challenge.

What do we cover?

As a Project Volunteer we will reimburse reasonable travel expenses occurred when on assignment. As a policy we do not cover any other expenses however, some additional costs may be agreed to by your Staffing Associate. These will be looked at on a case by case basis. Please discuss additional costs with your staffing associate before submitting an expense.

Please submit your expenses on this form so that we can arrange for a reimbursement.

What do you need to do?

Please follow these steps:

Scan or photograph your receipts from the summer.

Itemise your expenses and upload scans or photographs of your receipts on the online form.
Submit the form
Please also send your receipts to programme.expenses@the-challenge.org
The form can be re-used for further claims
Please ensure that you retain all receipts until you have been paid your expenses.

You can submit the form as many times as you need to fit all your expenses.



We can only accept scanned or clearly photographed receipts. Paper receipts handed in or posted will not be processed.



We encourage you to submit your expenses as soon you finish your placement. This will help to ensure you are reimbursed as quickly as possible.



When will I be paid?



Your claim will be authorised if everything is completed correctly. We will aim to pay all expenses directly into your bank account within two weeks of receiving your claim.



Expenses will be paid to you on a monthly basis and need to be submitted before the first and third Sunday of the month to avoid delays to repayment.



The deadline for the submission of expenses is 31 October 2014. Any expenses submitted after this date will not be paid.
