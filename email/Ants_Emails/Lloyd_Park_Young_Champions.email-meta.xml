    <textOnly>Hey Challenge East!  

Fancy getting involved in some event planning and management? 
Want to express your creativity and have a say in local events for you and your peers? 

Then get involved in The Lloyd Park Young Champions!!

Become a Young Champion to:
•	Get skills and experience for your CV--working on a council-funded programme will certainly stand out on any CV!
•	Share your passion and inspire others
•	Meet new people and get more confident
Lloyd Park is Your Park. You get to:
•	Design your own exciting projects for young people
•	Run activities: sports, film, arts, music, performance, environmental, media and more...
•	Fundraise to make your ideas reality
•	Represent your friends and community 

Come along to meetings and plan and put on events in the park to get other young people engaged with the park. The Young Champions have one more event to put on before the end of March and it would be great to get everyone&apos;s ideas for it. The Loyd Park Young Champions have been commissioned by the Council to run these events, so they are very important and have a lot of potential for creativity and excitement. 

Previous events have included:
-DJ workshop
-Bushcraft survival skills workshop
-T-shirt printing and bag making
-Olympic Sports Day. 


At the meeting we will be planning the next event to take place and how to recruit more young people to the programme. 

This is the first of a series of meetings: 
Date: Wednesday 27th February 
Time:5.30-7.30pm 
Venue: ROOM 3, Waltham Forest Town Hall, Forest Rd, E17 4JF
