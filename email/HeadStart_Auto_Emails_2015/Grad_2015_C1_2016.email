<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName},&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">I hope you&#39;re having a lovely evening in this wonderful London sunshine.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">I wanted to take a few minutes to re-introduce you to HeadStart - a programme delivered by The Challenge in partnership with leading companies including Lloyds Banking Group, New Look,&nbsp;Bloomberg and Starbucks to get you ready to succeed at&nbsp;university and work.&nbsp;Our website struggled to keep up with demand last week, so we&rsquo;ve been asked to keep applications open a further few days to make sure everyone can apply that would like to.&nbsp;If you haven&rsquo;t yet reserved your place, your countdown is on to make sure you are part of HeadStart London 2016. You can apply <a href="https://www.headstart-thechallenge.org/confirm-email/">here</a>&nbsp;by re-confirming&nbsp;your email.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">HeadStart is simple:&nbsp;volunteer for 16 hours and we will give you a guaranteed interview for a paid job with our&nbsp;corporate partner of your choice. That&rsquo;s how much employers value you giving your time to make a difference in your community.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">As well as helping you make&nbsp;a real impact through your volunteering, HeadStart will get you ready for work through professional workshops co-designed and delivered with our corporate partners, including communications, interview preparation, and customer service. As a result, HeadStart graduates are more employable to&nbsp;leading companies.&nbsp;</span></span><em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong style="font-size: 12px;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen a real difference in the calibre of young people coming through HeadStart. In practice we have found them to have better customer service aptitude and more confidence when joining our workforce.&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></span></span></em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong style="font-size: 12px;">Danny Barrasso, Deputy CEO, New Look. </strong></span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">You can learn a bit more about the programme through our new video&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4y4AvgpLEk" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">here</a><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
