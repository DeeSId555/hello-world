    <subject>HeadStart: The countdown is on!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you&apos;re having a lovely evening in this rare London sunshine.

I wanted to take a few minutes to re-introduce you to HeadStart - a programme delivered by The Challenge in partnership with leading companies including Lloyds Banking Group, Bloomberg and Starbucks to get young people like you ready for university and work. Our website struggled to keep up with demand last week, so we’ve been asked to keep applications open a further few days to make sure everyone can apply that would like to. If you haven’t yet reserved your place, your countdown is on to make sure you are part of HeadStart London 2016. You can apply by re-confirming your email here: https://www.headstart-thechallenge.org/confirm-email/.

HeadStart is simple: volunteer for 16 hours and we will give you a guaranteed interview for a part-time job with a leading company, including Starbucks, New Look and Lloyds Banking Group. That’s how much employers value you giving your time to make a difference in your community.

As well as making a real impact through your volunteering, HeadStart will get you ready for work through professional workshops co-designed and delivered with our corporate partners, including communications, interview preparation, and customer service. As a result HeadStart graduates are more employable for leading companies: “We’ve seen a real difference in the calibre of young people coming through HeadStart. In practice we have found them to have better customer service aptitude and more confidence when joining our workforce.” Danny Barrasso, Deputy CEO, New Look

If you have already signed up, we look forward to meeting you at the HeadStart Kick Off later this week!

Enjoy the rest of your evening.

All the best,

Emma


Emma Jenkins

Head of Development and HeadStart,
