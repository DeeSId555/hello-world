    <subject>Thank you! We&apos;ve received your application!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey, {!HS_Activity__c.Young_Person__c}!
Welcome to HeadStart!


**
THANK YOU!
------------------------------------------------------------
You have successfully submitted your application!

Thankyou for letting us know the HeadStart charity partners you would like to volunteer with. Your placement will be confirmed in the next couple of days. Once it is confirmed, you will be able to access your HeadStart Profile (http://headstart-thechallenge.org)  and see all details there. You will also receive an email to remind you to check!

We aim to match everyone to one of their first 3 volunteering preferences. However, all placements are on a first come, first served basis. If we are unable to match you with one of these preferences, we will inform you ASAP.

This wouldn&apos;t stop you completing HeadStart though! We&apos;ll give you tips and tools to help you find a new placement!

Kick Off is an awesome opportunity to launch your HeadStart journey and prepare yourself to get ahead! You will be encouraged to explore your journey options, set your own goals, understand how you can use your volunteering to achieve them and learn about how to make the most of your volunteering!

Once your placement has been confirmed, you will be able to RSVP  to your preferred Kick Off on your HeadStart Profile. (http://headstart-thechallenge.org)

Make sure you keep an eye on yours emails and RSVP ASAP - tickets are limited!
Follow us on social media and tell us why you&apos;ve signed up to HeadStart! We&apos;re giving away prizes to the best post from a HeadStarter on every NCS Summer wave!
