Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

You are one step away from beginning your HeadStart journey. If you&apos;ve already booked your ticket for the Kick Off and first workshop, we&apos;ll see you then.

If you haven&apos;t - NOW is the time! The Kick Off will give you everything you need to make the most of your HeadStart experience this summer, including key dates, details on workshops and top tips to stand out for future employers. The aim of the first workshop is to understand key attributes employers look for, and how to get the most out of your volunteering experience. We will also do some work on networking and making first impressions count.

We have secured some AMAZING Kick Off venues which you can book your place at by clicking on the following links. Places are limited and are on a strictly first come first served basis:

Friday 31st July @ Bloomberg’s amazing HQ in Finsbury Square. 50+ staff from this leading global business will be joining us for an exclusive networking event on the day. An incredible opportunity for anyone wanting to get into media.
Friday 7th August @ Univeristy of West London, Brentford site

Looking forward to seeing you there!
