Get a guaranteed interview for a paid part-time/seasonal job with New Look, Starbucks or Lloyd’s Banking Group, or an exclusive paid internship with the Mayor of London’s office or Zendesk.


HeadStart will help you:

Gain skills and experience

Stand out on your UCAS form

Meet new people and get back together with friends from NCS
