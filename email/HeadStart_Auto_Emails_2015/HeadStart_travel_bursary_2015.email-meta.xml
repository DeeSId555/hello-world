HeadStart travel bursary application


Dear {!Contact.FirstName}


Thank you for applying to be part of HeadStart.

We understand from your application form that you would like to request a HeadStart travel bursary. Travel bursaries are there to support volunteers who would not otherwise be able to cover their travel costs to attend volunteering placements. It should help to cover the cost of any public transport journey to and from your volunteering placement. A travel bursary is not for taxi use or to help with any form or petrol costs.


When choosing your placement, you should consider the cost of travel as we cannot fund volunteers who simply have a long commute.


We will require a copy of all of your travel tickets and receipts before we are able to refund you the money you have had to pay out.  We are unfortunately unable to provide any money in advance.


Once you have received confirmation of your volunteering placement, can you please have your parent/guardian complete the below form and email it back to headstart@the-challenge.org.


By filling out this form we are not guaranteeing that you will be eligible for a travel bursary and further communication with your parent/guardian will be required.
