At the workshop, you practised and improved your interview technique, however remember that in order to get that interview you first need to wow the employer with a stand-out CV. This is the first – and only – impression an employer will get before they meet you. Make sure you are honest in your CV as an Employer may ask you questions about it during interviews. It’s really important that you show your CV to a teacher or parent and ask them for feedback before you upload it.
