Dear {!Step_Forward_Associate_Attendance__c.Associate_First_Name__c}


Thank you for attending your recent interview.  As you know, Step Forward is a very competitive programme and ultimately it&apos;s up to the employer who they choose to make an offer of employment - no one is guaranteed a job.


Unfortunately, you have been unsuccessful in your interview with {!Step_Forward_Associate_Attendance__c.Employer_Name__c} for the role of {!Step_Forward_Associate_Attendance__c.SF_Job_Name__c}.  We want to provide you with some feedback that you can use for your future development.

The employer said that you performed well in the following areas: {!Step_Forward_Associate_Attendance__c.Areas_of_Strength__c}

They suggest areas of development are: {!Step_Forward_Associate_Attendance__c.Areas_of_Development__c}

Think back on the interview and how you could have improved based on the feedback above.  These could be things to work on for your next professional interview.


Please note that we cannot guarantee you further interviews with Step Forward. However, if a suitable position becomes available we will contact you by email.

In the meantime, please reply to stepforward.interview@the-challenge.org if you have any questions.


All the best,
