    <textOnly>Interview Feedback


Dear {!Step_Forward_Job__c.Employer__c},


We hope that your interview with {!Step_Forward_Associate_Attendance__c.Name} went well.


As part of the interview process, we require employers to submit interview feedback in order to assess a candidateâ€™s suitability to any organisation. To facilitate this process, we have attached a link to an online survey designed to communicate your impressions of the candidate. We will share some of this feedback with the candidate so they can develop professionally.  Please note you willl receive a separate email and feedback link for each candidate you interviewed.

Click here to complete the form for the above named Associate

Please fill this form within the next two days. Since most candidates will be attending interviews for multiple roles, we will not be able to allocate anyone to any organisation until all feedback has been collected.

Apprentices will also complete a similar form. This will ensure candidates are matched to jobs which they are passionate about.


If you have any questions regarding any aspect of the process, please do not hesitate to contact your Account Manager who will be happy to help you.


Best wishes,

Step Forward Matching Team
