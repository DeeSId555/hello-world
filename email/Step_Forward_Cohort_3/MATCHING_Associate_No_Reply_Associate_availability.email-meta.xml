Hello {!Step_Forward_Associate_Attendance__c.Associate_First_Name__c},


We havenâ€™t received a response to our last 2 emails regarding an interview with a Step Forward employer.  Unfortunately you are no longer eligible for this interview and we cannot guarantee that we can re-arrange this for you.

Please contact our office to discuss your future availability and any other questions you may have about interviews.


All the best,

Step Forward Matching Team
