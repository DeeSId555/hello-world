    <subject>Summer Reunion - South London Wave 7</subject>
    <textOnly>Calling all Challenger from South London Wave 7!!

It&apos;s the start of the summer...and we might even have some sun if we&apos;re lucky.

So it&apos;s been almost a year since the summer programme last year. Anyone missing their wave? Wishing they were back on that night hike? Hoping to be reunited with the community groups? Jealous of everyone heading off this summer?

I&apos;ve been catching up with people over the past few weeks...and quite a lot of you suggested a reunion would be a nice idea.

So....how would you feel about meeting up soon?! A couple of you are off on holiday in July so we were thinking next week. MONDAY 2nd JULY from 4pm.

There have been lots of demands for a BBQ! Ask and we will deliver :)) - so a BBQ you will have! I&apos;m checking out central South London venues so will let you know asap where we will be.

Any ideas for food, entertainment, music - just let me know and you can organise your friends or bring it along.

Coming? Please join on Facebook or reply to this email saying YES! If you&apos;re in touch with others from the wave, why not get in touch and see if they are going too.

I&apos;m really looking forward to catching up with you all, hearing your stories and finding out what your plans are now.
