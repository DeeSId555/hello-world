 Dear {!Contact.FirstName}
 
You are receiving this email because you expressed an interest in becoming a Challenge Journalist. 

We are holding our first meeting on the 15th January from 6pm-7pm at Highgate Studios, Highgate Road, NW5 1TL. See where on this map http://goo.gl/maps/JHljK 

We will be discussing exactly what you want to create - a magazine, a blog, a newsletter you can decide! We need people with lots of different skills from writing to photography to editing to graphic design. 

If you are unable to make the first meeting because you live too far away then don&apos;t worry - we will keep in touch with what is going on and you will be able to take part as a journalist online. 


Please respond to this email saying if you can attend. If you are unable to attend please let us know what skills you have or would like to learn so that we can include you in the project at a later date. 

See you there!
