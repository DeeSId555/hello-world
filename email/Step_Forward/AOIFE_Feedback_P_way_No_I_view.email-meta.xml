    <textOnly>Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},


Thank you for attending the assessment in November. We hope that it was a useful introduction to the interview and assessment process.

As promised, below is your individual feedback which is designed to help you assess areas of strength and areas for improvement to use in future assessments.

We apologise but due to the high number of applicants we are not able to provide any further feedback at this time.

Thank you once again for taking the time to submit an application and coming in to meet our team.


Best wishes,
