Dear {!Step_Forward_Job_Placement__c.Associate__c},

Thank you for everything you have contributed so far to Step Forward.

This barometer helps us to review how you are finding the programme. We are looking to continue building on the things that are going well and make changes and improvements to any areas that are not going well. It should not take longer than 3 minutes to complete.

Please be aware that we may be in touch for more details about your responses. As always, please be honest and as specific as possible.

Many thanks,

Emma
Programme Manager
