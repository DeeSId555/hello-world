    <textOnly>Your CV and Skills &amp; Experience Survey


Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},

Thanks for attending yesterday&apos;s fast-track assessment for Step Forward and congratulations on receiving a conditional offer!

Before you can move on to the final matching stage of the application process, you will need to submit 2 more things - firstly, a great quality CV (only the best will be accepted!) and secondly, complete a skills survey.

**Remember that we are only matching candidates for interview until mid-late August, so to be in with a chance of securing an interview, you must complete both things ASAP**

1) Skills &amp; Experience Survey

Please complete this form below to let us know your interests and experience in relation to your pathways.

(this link is personal to you so please do not forward this email to anyone else).

2) Your CVs

As mentioned at yesterday&apos;s assessment – the final versions of your CV (1 for each pathway) must be written in the Step Forward template and uploaded via the link below.

You must show your CV to a teacher or parent and ask them for feedback before you upload it. Unchecked CVs will not be accepted and put forward to potential employers.

A reminder of some key things to include on your CV:

Personal Statement:

3-5 key strengths
A sentence ori two explaining why you want to do your chosen pathway
Achievements you’re most proud of
200 words max.

We&apos;ve included the templates below for you again. Download the template CV for each of your pathways, if you haven&apos;t already. Please remember that you must use these documents as a template to write your personal CV. Unfortunately we cannot accept a CV using a different format.
