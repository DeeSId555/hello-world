Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},

Hello from Step Forward.  Congratulations again on your conditional offer to be on Step Forward in September.  Step Forward is a competitive programme – we have received around 5,000 expressions of interest for a limited number of places this year – so only the best applicants have got this far.  Well done!

The next step in the process is to start arranging interviews for you with employers which will be taking place immediately. We cannot put you forward for interviews until the character survey and CVs are completed so please make sure you do them as soon as possible.

We want you to really impress these employers.  To do this we need you to tell us a bit more about you.  It is important that only you use these links so please don&apos;t forward this email to anyone else.

1) Character survey

This should take no more than 5 minutes and needs to be completed by Monday 20th July. Click here to complete your survey (this link is personal to you so please do not forward this email to anyone else).

2) Your CV

This will take a few days to plan and the final version should be completed by Monday 20th July.

Important Information about writing your CV

A CV is important as it is the first impression an employer will get before they meet you.  The CV you write for Step Forward will be useful throughout your career, so this is something you can save and build on for your future.  Make sure you are honest in your CV as an Employer may ask you questions about it during interviews.

Attached to this email is &apos;Your Step Forward CV&apos;.  You must use this document as a template to write your personal CV.  You must save a final copy of your CV as a Word document, then upload and send it to us by clicking here.
Your final CV must fit onto one page of A4 only. The font should be &apos;Calibri&apos; in size 11.  Spell check does not work in the template.  You should type your CV on a separate Word document first, check the spelling and grammar, then copy and paste into the template.

Attached is guidance on ‘How to write your Step Forward CV’ with advice and examples of how to write a great CV to impress an employer.
We can’t put you forward for interviews unless you have sent us your CV so it’s important you complete this by Monday 13th July.

If you have any questions about how to complete these, do give us a ring – we are here to help!  You can contact us on 0203 542 2400.
