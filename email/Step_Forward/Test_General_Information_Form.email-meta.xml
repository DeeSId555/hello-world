Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},


Please click here to complete your Step Forward General Information Form.

This will require some basic information about yourself that we will use during induction, for registration purposes as well as through the programme. You must answer all questions within the next seven days. If you have any questions please call us on 020 3542 2404.

Kind regards,

The Step Forward Team
