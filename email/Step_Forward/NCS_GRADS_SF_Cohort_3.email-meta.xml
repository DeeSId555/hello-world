Hello,

We have a few available places on Step Forward brought to you by The Challenge. Come in for a chat and we will try to match you with a quality employer the same day.

Step Forward is a London based 12 month work placement for school and college leavers. You will gain invaluable experience, fantastic training, a qualification and make lots of new friends - all whilst benefiting from the help and advice of an experienced mentor.

The programme is your first step to building your future career, whether you want to go on to university, straight into the world of work or youâ€™re just not sure.

If you are interested we would like to invite you in to meet us at our office by Waterloo Station.
