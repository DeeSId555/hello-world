Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for attending the recent Step Forward assessment and interview.  We really enjoyed meeting you and were very impressed with the skills and attributes that you demonstrated.

Step Forward is a competitive programme and the standard of applicants has been extremely high; well done for reaching this stage of the process. We assessed a large number of very high calibre candidates that we would love to take on further in the application process. As there are a very limited number of places on the programme we do not have space to take on everybody that we would like to.

As a result, after much time and consideration we are very sorry to let you know that we are unable to take your application any further. Your interest in and passion for the Step Forward programme were impressive, however, other applicants more closely matched the attributes we were looking for.

We give feedback to everybody who attends an assessment.  Due to the large number of people being assessed, this takes some time, but individual feedback will be sent to you in a few weeks to help you assess areas of strength and areas for improvement.

We would like to direct you to other suitable organisations who also offer programmes in the area/s that you&apos;re interested. The organisations and links to their websites are listed below:


Business Support Services

National Apprenticeship Service

City Gateway

Just IT

Thank you for taking the time to submit an application and come in and meet our team. We hope that whilst this is not the outcome you were hoping for, that you found the application process useful and have developed skills to assist in future applications.

We wish you the best of luck in your future career.


Best wishes,


Step Forward
