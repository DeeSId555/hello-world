Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},

Hello from Step Forward. Congratulations again on your conditional offer to be on the programme in August 2016. Step Forward is very competitive; we have received around 5,000 expressions of interest for a limited number of places this year so only the best applicants have got this far. Well done!

We’re looking forward to seeing you at the interview preparation and CV workshops later, which are designed to help you prepare for your interviews.

Interviews will take place between March and July*, and you will need to do the following before we can put you forward for interviews:

Attend an interview prep and CV workshop
Confirm which pathway(s) you want to be considered for
Submit a completed CV in each pathway you want to be considered for


Below are 5 links to template CVs.  You don’t have to fill them in yet, because we will help you to complete a CV for each pathway during the workshop. You may want to bring a CV with you if you have one, or start thinking about what to write in order to impress the employers as much as possible.

Please don’t delete this email because you will use it during the session.

At the session you should download the following CVs below:

IT Pathway CV
