    <textOnly>Application Result

Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},


Thank you for showing your interest in Step Forward and taking the time to submit an application.

Step Forward is a competitive programme and the standard of applicants has been extremely high.  We have received a large number of applications, however there are a very limited number of places on the programme.  As a result, we are very sorry to let you know that we are unable to invite you to the next stage of the application process.

We hope that whilst this is not the outcome you were hoping for, you continue to seek further opportunities for your future career.


Best wishes,

The Step Forward Team
