We’ve moved you to the waiting list for NCS
 
Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

We’ve moved you to the waiting list for NCS - act now to increase your chances of taking part. 

We’ve tried to get in touch with your parent or guardian because we haven’t received everything we need to complete your application for NCS. As we’re still waiting for your application to be completed, we’ve had to move you to the waiting list. As NCS is a very popular programme, we can only save provisional places for a limited time whilst people complete their applications. 

If you still want to take part in NCS, please ask your parent or guardian to call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org. to let us know. We will then do everything we can to find a suitable NCS programme for you, or add you to more waiting lists to increase your chances of getting a place.
