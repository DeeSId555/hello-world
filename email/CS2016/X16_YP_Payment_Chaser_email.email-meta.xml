Don’t miss out on NCS - your admin fee


Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

It’s great that you want to take part in National Citizen Service (NCS) – but we don’t want you to miss out because of a missing admin fee!

We’ve contacted your parent or guardian to explain that we’ve temporarily saved you a provisional place on NCS but they need to pay your admin fee to keep your provisional place. Remember, your NCS admin fee will be a maximum of £50.

We also explained how they can ask for financial assistance if they need help with the cost, because we would never want the cost to stop you taking part.

We can only save your provisional place on NCS until {!NCS_Application__c.Letter_email_date_reserved_place_lost__c} without this payment, so please ask your parent or guardian to pay or to contact us if they need any help with the payment so we can have a chat. They can pay by:

logging in to their account on our website at bookings.ncsthechallenge.org, or
calling us on 0203 542 2400 to pay over the phone, or arrange sending us a cheque.

Any questions?
Get in touch by emailing us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org or calling us on 0203 542 2400.

Speak to your parent or guardian as soon as you can to give yourself the best chance of taking part in this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Kind regards,


Tanya Dunne
