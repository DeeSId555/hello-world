Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

After you told us you were interested in National Citizen Service (NCS), we wanted to remind  you to get signed up as soon as possible so you have the best chance of getting a place!

What&apos;s NCS again?

✔ An exciting way to spend part of your summer.

✔ A chance for 15-17 year olds1 like you to make new friends and try new things – including activities which allow you to make a difference in the community.

✔ An opportunity to build the skills and confidence you need to help you in your future, for example when applying for jobs or university.

What does the NCS programme look like?*

Part 1 - Get Active:
Five days (four nights) staying away from home in the countryside doing outdoor adventure activities like canoeing, hiking, and rock climbing with your new teammates.

Part 2 - Get Involved:
Five days (four nights) living independently away from home developing skills in either drama, enterprise, media, music, photography, art or sport. You will also work with organisations or local businesses to get involved in the community around you.

Part 3- Make Your Mark:
Community activity days (staying at home at night) where you and your team create your own project to benefit the local area and pitch your ideas to a panel of judges to win funding for it. You then use this funding to make your ideas come to life by carrying out your team project in the local community.

So don&apos;t miss out! This is what you could be looking forward to...

*Some of our programmes have a slightly different structure and activities may vary. They still have the same key benefits though!
