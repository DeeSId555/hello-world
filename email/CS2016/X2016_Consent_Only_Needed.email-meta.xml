Consent for {!Contact.Name} to take part in NCS



Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

We need {!Contact.Name}’s parent or legal guardian to sign a consent form for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in NCS. The person who signs this consent form must be the same parent or legal guardian who filled in the NCS Application Form (including all medical and support information).

If you did not complete the rest of the application for NCS and are unable to pass the form below on to the person who did, please call us on 0333 150 2425. We can then arrange to get consent from the right person as soon as possible.

If you did fill in the NCS Application Form, please print the form below, read the consent statement on it and give consent if you are happy with everything:

You can then return the form to us by scanning and emailing it to inclusion.support@the-challenge.org or posting it to: The Challenge, Elizabeth House, 39 York Road, London, SE1 7NQ.

Please do act as soon as you can, as we need this consent before we can fully process {!Contact.FirstName}’s application. If you have any questions, please get in touch with us using the phone number and email address above.

Yours sincerely,
