NCS application: your next steps


Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

Your payment deadline for {!Contact.Name}&apos;s NCS application


Thank you for your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in National Citizen Service (NCS). We have temporarily saved them a provisional place on the programme but you need to pay your admin fee by {!NCS_Application__c.Letter_email_date_reserved_place_lost__c} to keep {!Contact.FirstName}’s provisional place. Remember, your NCS admin fee will be a maximum of £50.

Places on NCS are in high demand so if we have not received the payment by {!NCS_Application__c.Letter_email_date_reserved_place_lost__c}, we will have to move {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list and give the place to another young person.

To pay, please:

log in to our website at bookings.ncsthechallenge.org (If you have forgotten your log in details, you can recover them by clicking &apos;login&apos; and then clicking the &quot;Forgotten password?&quot; button), or

call us on 0203 542 2400 to pay over the phone or arrange sending us a cheque.

We will then be able to continue processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s application.

We wouldn’t want the cost to stop {!Contact.FirstName} taking part. If finding the money is a problem for you, we may be able to help. Please log in to your online account, go to the payment section and select the option to ask for financial assistance. Alternatively, give us a call and we will be happy to advise you.

Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Service
The Challenge (largest provider of NCS)
