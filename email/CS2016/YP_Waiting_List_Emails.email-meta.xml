Increase your chance of having this 
once-in-a-lifetime experience!
 
Hi {!Contact.Name}, 

You are on the waiting list for National Citizen Service (NCS) at the moment. You do still have a good chance of getting a place, though! 

What are the next steps?
We’ve been in touch with your parent or guardian explaining that they need to pay the {!Contact.Amount_due_outstanding__c} admin fee for your application (which will go up to £50 after {!Contact.School_s_discount_deadline__c}), or ask for financial support. We will be able to process your application more quickly if a place comes up, so please ask your parent or guardian to do this as soon as possible.

They can log in to pay, to confirm if you can travel further, or to add extra suitable dates. The more dates they add, the greater your chances of taking part in NCS.

They can also contact us directly on 020 3542 2400 or contact@ncsthechallenge.org.

When will you find out more?
We will call you if a place becomes available. This can be at any time, right up to the programme start date. 

We hope we can offer you a place soon!
