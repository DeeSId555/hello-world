Due to unforeseen circumstances, we have had to change the outdoor centre for the first part of {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s NCS programme.

{!Contact.FirstName} will now be staying at Henley Fort Outdoor Education Centre in Guildford, Surrey.

The meeting point for Friday 15 July is still the same.
