We&apos;ve moved {!Contact.FirstName} 
to the waiting list for NCS

Dear {!IF&quot;(!Contact.Parent_Name__c)&quot;=&quot;&quot; &quot;Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName}&quot; &quot;{!Contact.Parent_Name__c}&quot; 

We’ve moved {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list for NCS - act now to increase their chances of taking part. 

We’ve tried to contact you to ask you to complete {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS. As we’re still waiting to hear back from you, we’ve had to move {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list. As NCS is a very popular programme, we can only reserve provisional places for a limited time whilst people complete their applications. 

If {!Contact.FirstName} still wants to take part in NCS, please call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org to let us know. 

We will then do everything we can to find a suitable NCS programme for {!Contact.FirstName}, or add them to more waiting lists to increase their chances of getting a place.
