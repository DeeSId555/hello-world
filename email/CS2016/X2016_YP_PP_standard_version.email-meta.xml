Your NCS Info Pack
 
Hey {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Your NCS adventure is almost here – get excited! To prepare, read this info pack carefully... 

What&apos;s inside?

Your NCS Timetable – tells you when and where to meet and where you’ll stay in the residential parts. Click here to see this: {!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}.

Your Quick Summer Guide – gives you essential information, including packing lists. Click here to see this: {!Wave__c.Programme_booklet_YP__c}

What else do I need to do?

Make sure we have all the information we need to take you away safely, especially full medical and support information and emergency contact details.

Remind your parent or guardian to read their own info pack and do the things listed in it. If they haven’t received it, call 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org so we can get it to them. It’s important.

If you have any questions or worries, or if there’s any information we need to know so we can support you on NCS, please get in touch using the details above.

Can’t make it anymore? Contact us so we can offer this experience of a lifetime to someone else.

So… happy packing! We can’t wait to welcome you on your NCS adventure!
