Thanks for your interest in NCS



Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for letting us know you&apos;re interested in NCS. We are The Challenge and we&apos;ll be running NCS in your area next summer. We understand you have a question for us about NCS. We now have your contact details and will be in touch as soon as possible to answer your query.

In the meantime, take a look at questions.ncsthechallenge.org. If you find the information you need, you can go ahead and sign up for NCS at www.NCSTheChallenge.org. Use the following unique login details to apply online:

NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

The website will tell you that some parts of your application must be completed by your parent or guardian. Please ask your parent or guardian to complete these parts. 

It is quicker to apply online but if your parent or guardian would like a paper copy of the application form instead, please call us on 020 3542 2400 and we’ll send one out in the post.

Don&apos;t worry if you need more information first as we&apos;ll be in touch if you don&apos;t complete your application.

Yours sincerely,

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
