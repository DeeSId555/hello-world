NCS - attendance update

Dear {!IF(Contact.Parent_Name__c &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;&amp; ( Contact.Parent_Name__c ) &amp;&quot; &quot;,&quot;Parent or Guardian of (Contact.FirstName)&quot;)}, 

We hope {!Contact.FirstName} has really enjoyed NCS. 

We wanted to let you know that, based on our records of {!Contact.FirstName}’s attendance, They have missed too much of the programme to become an official NCS graduate. Unfortunately, this means {!Contact.FirstName} won’t be able to receive a certificate at the graduation ceremony. 

However, you are both still very welcome to come along to the graduation ceremony on {!Wave_Selection__c.Graduation_Date__c} to celebrate {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s achievements. You will receive an invite with full details soon, if you haven’t already. 

If you have any questions or need to get in touch with us about this, please contact us using the details below. 

Kind regards, 

Josie Whitworth
Head of Programmes and Staffing
