NCS absence form for {!Contact.FirstName}
  
Dear {!IF(Contact.Parent_Name__c&lt;&gt;&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;&amp;(Contact.Parent_Name__c)&amp;&quot;&quot;,&quot;Parent or Guardian&quot;)}, 

Thank you for letting us know that you want to request an absence from NCS for {!Contact.FirstName} 

You now need to fill in a form to give full details of your absence request. You will need to fill in information about each day that you&apos;re requesting for {!Contact.FirstName} to be absent. You can do this by clicking here: http://survey.clicktools.com/app/survey/response.jsp
You can only submit information using this link once. 

Please note:
- {!Contact.FirstName} cannot be absent for more than two days of NCS, or they may not be eligible to graduate from the programme.
- {!Contact.FirstName} may need to make up the hours missed by independently volunteering so they can graduate and receive their certificate. If this applies to {!Contact.FirstName}, they will be told how many hours they need to make up during NCS and we will send you an email. You and the young person will then need to organise some volunteering which aims to benefit the environment or community.
If you are unable to fill in this form online or have any questions, please contact us using the details below. 

Yours sincerely, 

The NCS Team - The Challenge
