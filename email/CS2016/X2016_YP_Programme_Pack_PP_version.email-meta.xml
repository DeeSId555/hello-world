Your NCS Info Pack
 
Hey  {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Even though your place on NCS is not confirmed yet, we think you’ve got a good chance of getting a confirmed place. So you can prepare, please read this info pack carefully... 

What’s inside?

-Your NCS Timetable – tells you when and where to meet and where young people will stay in the residential parts. You’ll need to travel to the meeting points and from the return points.  Click here to see this: {!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}. 
-Your Quick Summer Guide– gives you essential information, including packing lists. Click here to see this: {!Wave__c.Programme_booklet_YP__c}.

What else do I need to do?

- Make sure we have all the information we need to take you away safely, especially full medical and support information and emergency contact details.

- Remind your parent or guardian to read their own info pack and do the things listed in it. If they haven’t received it, call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org so we can get it to them. It’s important.

- If you have any questions or worries, or if there’s any information we need to know so we can support you on NCS, please get in touch using the details above.

What else do I need to know?

{!IF(Wave_Selection__c.All_girl_wave__c = &quot;Yes&quot;,&quot;
All young people and pastoral staff on this NCS programme will be female. However, there may be some male staff, or male young people from other groups, at the venues.

&quot;,&quot;&quot;)}
Please note that your place on NCS is not guaranteed - you will receive confirmation in writing if you get a confirmed place. We‘ve sent you this info pack because we think you have a good chance of this happening.

Happy reading! We&apos;ll be in touch soon.
