    <textOnly>Update to your local contact - NCS Information Evening
Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

There has been an update regarding your local contact.

I’m Ruth Hunt, your new local NCS contact up until your NCS start date. I’d like to invite you and your parent or guardian to come to a short information evening.

It’s a chance to find out more about NCS, ask questions, and meet others who have signed up.

Date: 6/06/2016
Time: 18:00 - 19:00
Address: Parchmore Methodist Church, 55 Parchmore Rd, Thornton Heath, CR7 8LY

Please let me know if you’re coming by sending an email to ruth.hunt@the-challenge.org - or you can call or text me on 07867545342.

If you can’t make it but would still like to meet us, we’ll be holding other information evenings for NCS programmes running in different areas, or on different dates - you can contact me for details.

I look forward to seeing you at your information evening!

Ruth Hunt
