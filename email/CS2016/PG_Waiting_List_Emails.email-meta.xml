{!Contact.FirstName} is on 
the waiting list for NCS
 
Dear {!IF(Contact.Parent_Name__c &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;&amp; ( Contact.Parent_Name__c ) &amp;&quot; &quot;,&quot;Parent or Guardian&quot;)}, 

Thank you for {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS.
NCS is a popular programme and {!Contact.FirstName} is on the waiting list at the moment. However, they still have a good chance of getting a place. 

What are your next steps?
To increase {!Contact.FirstName}’s chances, please pay now and we will be able to proceed more quickly if a place comes up. Thanks to Government backing, all you need to pay is a {!Contact.Amount_due_outstanding__c} admin fee{!IF(Contact.Days_until_discount_deadline__c &gt;1,&quot; if you pay before &quot;&amp;TEXT(DAY(Contact.School_s_discount_deadline__c))&amp;&quot;/&quot;&amp; TEXT(MONTH(Contact.School_s_discount_deadline__c))&amp;&quot;/&quot;&amp;(TEXT(YEAR(Contact.School_s_discount_deadline__c)))&amp;&quot;, or up to £50 after this date&quot;,&quot;&quot;)}. To pay, log in here and go to the payment section, or call us to pay over the phone or arrange sending a cheque.

We wouldn’t want the cost to stop {!Contact.FirstName} taking part - just tick the option for financial support when you log in online or contact us on 020 3542 2400 or contact@ncsthechallenge.org.

You can also log in to select other suitable programme dates. The more dates you add, the greater {!Contact.FirstName}’s chances of taking part in NCS.
You can also tick a box in the date selection if you are happy for {!Contact.FirstName} to travel to a programme which is further away and may have places available.

When will you find out more? 
We will call you if a place becomes available. This can be at any time, right up to the programme start date. 

We hope to be able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place soon!
