Recovering your NCS login details


Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for recovering your NCS login details.

We have made you a temporary password so you can log in to your account. You will then be asked to set a new password when you log in.

Your temporary login details are:

NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Temporary password: {!Contact.Login_Password__c}

If you have any problems, we are happy to help.  You can email us at contact@ncschallenge.org or call us on 0203 542 2400.

Yours sincerely,
