Completing your NCS application



Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for letting us know you&apos;re interested in NCS. We are The Challenge and we&apos;ll be running NCS in your area in 2016.

Here&apos;s a taster of what NCS is all about...
http://youtu.be/YEpX7Q2-CVQ

NCS is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet new people, make new friends and build the skills and confidence to help you get ahead. Over 130,000 young people have already taken part - don&apos;t miss your chance!

When is NCS running in 2016?
NCS runs at two different times throughout the year:
-        During the summer – we have lots of start dates throughout the summer holidays.
-        October half-term, with 4 weekend days after.

This means you can choose a time which fits with your plans.

Interested in our Summer programme?
Check out www.NCSTheChallenge.org at the start of January to start your application (your parent or guardian will need to complete parts of the application – the website will guide you through this).

You&apos;ll need to be the right age though - see our age eligibility requirements at www.NCSTheChallenge.org/terms. For more details, check out  NCSTheChallenge.org.

Interested in our October 2016 half-term programme?
Check out www.NCSTheChallenge.org at the start of summer or call us on 020 3542 2400.

Is there a cost?
Even though each place is valued at over £1000, government backing means NCS costs you no more than a £50 admin fee.  Plus, you get an extra £5 discount when you sign up online!

Any questions?
If you have any questions, take a look at  questions.ncsthechallenge.org or get in touch by calling 020 3542 2400 or emailing contact@the-challenge.org.

Yours sincerely,

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge

*Our programmes run over a time which will be half-term for the majority of schools in the areas we operate in. Please see our online application for exact dates, or contact us directly.
