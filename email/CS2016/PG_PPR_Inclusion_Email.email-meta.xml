We&apos;ve moved {!Contact.FirstName}
to the waiting list for NCS
 
Dear {!IF&quot;(!Contact.Parent_Name__c)&quot;=&quot;&quot; &quot;Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName}&quot; &quot;{!Contact.Parent_Name__c}&quot;, 

We’ve moved {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list for NCS - act now to increase their chances of taking part. 

We sent you a letter or an email on {!Inclusion_Details__c.Inclusion_no_response_letter_email_sent__c} asking you to provide more medical and support information for {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS. However, as we’re still waiting to hear back from you and the timeframe we gave you has now passed, we’ve had to move {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list. 

As NCS is a very popular programme, we can only reserve provisional places for a limited time if we are missing information. If another place becomes available, we may contact you to see if {!Contact.FirstName} is still interested in attending NCS. 

If {!Contact.FirstName} still wants to take part in NCS, please call us on 0333 150 2425 and explain you need to provide further medical and support information. Once we have the information, we will then do everything we can to find a suitable NCS programme for them. 

If you would like to find out more information about NCS in the meantime, please go to questions.ncsthechallenge.org. We hope to hear from you soon.
