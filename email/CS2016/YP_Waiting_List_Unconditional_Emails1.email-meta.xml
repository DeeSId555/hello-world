You are on the waiting list for NCS
 
Hi {!Contact.Name}, 

You are on the waiting list for National Citizen Service (NCS) at the moment. You do still have a good chance of getting a place, though! 

How can you increase your chances of getting a place?
We’ve been in touch with your parent or guardian explaining that they can log in to confirm if you can travel further, or to add extra suitable dates. The more dates they add, the greater your chances of taking part in NCS.

When will you find out more?
We will call you if a place becomes available. This can be at any time, right up to the programme start date. 

In the meantime, if you have any questions, you can call us on 020 3542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org. 

We hope we can offer you a place soon!
