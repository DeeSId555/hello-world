We&apos;ve moved {!Contact.FirstName} 
to the waiting list for NCS
 
Dear {!IF&quot;(!Contact.Parent_Name__c)&quot;=&quot;&quot; &quot;Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName}&quot; &quot;{!Contact.Parent_Name__c}&quot;, 

We’ve moved {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list for NCS - act now to increase their chances of taking part. 

We sent you an email on {! IF( asking you to pay your admin fee for {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS. As we’re still waiting to receive this and the deadline has now passed, we’ve had to move {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list. As NCS is a very popular programme, we can only reserve provisional places for a limited time if we are missing the admin fee. 

If {!Contact.FirstName} still wants to take part in NCS, please call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org to let us know and discuss making the payment. We wouldn’t want the cost to stop {!Contact.FirstName} taking part, so we have financial support available - please let us know if you would like to request this. 

We will then do everything we can to find a suitable NCS programme for {!Contact.FirstName}, or add them to more waiting lists to increase their chances of getting a place.
