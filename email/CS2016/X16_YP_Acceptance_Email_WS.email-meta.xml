Your programme will be starting on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c}{!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_Girls_Only_Wave__c}. We&apos;ve sent your parent or guardian a letter or email to let them know you have a confirmed place too.

Staying away from home: {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} until {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_Return_Day__c}

What will happen next?

Approximately one month before the start date, we will send you:

An information pack for your NCS programme. This will give you meeting points, times and other important information, such as a packing list.

An invitation to an information evening happening a week or two before you start NCS. Here you and your parent or guardian will have the chance to meet us and ask any questions.

You&apos;ll get your free NCS T-shirt – exclusively for NCS participants - either when we visit your school or college again or on the first day of NCS.
