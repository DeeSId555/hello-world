Your NCS Info Pack
 
Hey {!Contact.Name}, 

Thanks for agreeing to come to the first day of NCS on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} with your bags packed and ready to take a place if one comes up! 

Although you’re still on the waiting list, each year some people can’t make it at short notice. If a place doesn’t become available and you end up going home, though, we’ll give you a shopping voucher and you can have a refund.

Meanwhile, to prepare for NCS, read this info pack carefully... 

What&apos;s inside?

- Your NCS Timetable – tells you when and where to meet and where the young people will stay in the residential parts. If you get a place, you’ll need to travel to all the meeting points and from the return points. Click here to see this: {!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}.

- Your Quick Summer Guide – giving you essential information, including packing lists. Click here to see this: {!Wave__c.Programme_booklet_YP__c} 

What else do I need to do?

- Make sure we have all the information we need to take you away safely, especially full medical and support information and emergency contact details.

- Remind your parent or guardian to read their own info pack and do the things listed in it. If they haven’t received it, call us on 0203 542 2400 or email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org so we can get it to them. It’s important.

- If you have any questions or worries, or if there’s any information we need to know so we can support you on NCS, please get in touch using the details above.

- Can’t make it anymore? Contact us so we can offer this opportunity to someone else.

{!IF(Wave_Selection__c.All_girl_wave__c = &quot;Yes&quot;,&quot; What else do I need to know?
All young people and pastoral staff on this NCS programme will be female. However, there may be some male staff, or male young people from other groups, at the venues.
&quot;,&quot;&quot;)} 

Happy packing! We’re really looking forward to seeing you on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} and we do hope you get a place!
