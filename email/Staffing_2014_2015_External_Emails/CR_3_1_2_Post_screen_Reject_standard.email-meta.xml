Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for taking the time to apply for one of our seasonal roles on the 2016 NCS seasonal programmes.



We regret to inform you that we will not be taking your application to assessment stage. We receive a huge number of applications for our seasonal roles each week and as a result competition is very high. Unfortunately, on this occasion, we did not feel that the experience or the skills you have outlined met our required criteria. This decision is final, and you won&apos;t be able to reapply for another role this year - however, if you gain relevant experience over the coming year, you will be more than welcome to reapply in 2017.



Due to the volume of applications we receive, we are unable to provide individual feedback to candidates.



Thank you again for your interest in The Challenge and the NCS programmes.



Best wishes,



The Staffing Team
