Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for attending our assessment for a seasonal role on the NCS programme. Unfortunately, we are not able to take your application any further.

Our seasonal roles benefit from plenty of experience of working with young people, and we look for candidates who meet a wide range of criteria. Unfortunately, on this occasion we did not feel that you were suited to the roles which you were being assessed for.

If, in the future, you feel that you have gained additional experience and would like to apply for our seasonal roles once again, we would absolutely encourage you to monitor our website and register your interest in the 2017 NCS programmes.

We regret that we are unable to provide individual feedback to applicants. This is due to the high volume of applications we receive, and the number of candidates we assess.

We appreciate you taking the time to apply to work with us, and thank you again for your interest in the NCS programme.

Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
