Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Welcome back! We are delighted to invite you to return to your role as a {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c} for the 2016 NCS programme.



DBS applications



In order to undertake a role on our programme it is an absolute requirement that candidates have a valid enhanced DBS certificate with children&apos;s barred list issued on or after 1st January 2015. Applicants who have not completed this process cannot be prioritised for placement and allocation. The process of obtaining this certification is fully funded by The Challenge and full instructions of the application process can be found here.

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/assets/2016DBSinstructionspostoffer.pdf

If you already have a valid DBS certificate that meets the above criteria then you will be able to upload this within the essential information section of the website. For more information about DBS certificates and applications please visit our FAQs.
