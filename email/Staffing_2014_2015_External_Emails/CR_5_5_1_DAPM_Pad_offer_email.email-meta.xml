Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations! Following your assessment we are delighted to provisionally offer you a role with us this summer as a {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}.

If you&apos;d like to refresh your memory and learn more about your role, please have a look at your role&apos;s job description on the link below:

http://www.ncsthechallenge.org/jobs/#available-opportunities

What now?

As you’ll be joining us in one of our regional offices for your role, you won’t need to go through the same online process as our other seasonal roles. Instead, we’ll be in touch soon to go through the process from here and take your availability and essential information.

DBS applications

In order to support the NCS programme, you will need to obtain an ‘Enhanced DBS with Children&apos;s Barred List check’. If you already have a valid certificate dated from 1 January 2015, please upload a scanned or photographed copy to the Essential Information page.

If you don’t already own a DBS certificate you can apply for a new one, paid for by us. The DBS process can sometimes take up to 6 weeks to process - make sure you start your application as soon as possible. Please follow these instructions on how to apply for a DBS certificate.
