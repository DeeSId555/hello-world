Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting an application to work on the 2016 NCS programmes.

Unfortunately, having reviewed your application, we do not feel that you currently have the right experience to take on one of our paid seasonal roles. We understand this is disappointing, but please do not be discouraged from applying in the future when you&apos;ve had the chance to develop your skills further!

Is there another way I can get involved?

Yes! As an NCS Graduate, you may be eligible to apply for an Associate Mentor role or our HeadStart programme.

Associate Mentor

The Associate Mentor role is a volunteering placement with the staff team on NCS. If you&apos;ve already completed an Associate Mentor placement, then you can simply apply for a Senior Associate Mentor role instead - taking on additional responsibilities - and taking another step towards a paid seasonal staff role.

These voluntary roles can help you make a huge positive impact on other young people&apos;s NCS experiences, whilst gaining valuable experience, developing some skills required for youth and community work.

To carry out the Associate Mentor role, you must have graduated from the NCS programme in 2014 or 2015.

For the Senior Associate Mentor role, you simply must have completed an Associate Mentor role previously!

How do I apply?

If you&apos;re interested in either the Associate Mentor or Senior Associate Mentor roles, you can register your interest by emailing graduates@the-challenge.org. Please use &quot;Associate Mentor 2016&quot; as the subject line of your email.

We&apos;ll make sure you&apos;re the first to hear when applications open (in spring 2016).

HeadStart

HeadStart is an exciting programme that will give you the skills and experience to get ahead.

The programme is simple.

1. Volunteer for 16+ hours with a local charity. HeadStart will help you find one that fits your interests and availability.

2. As soon as you start volunteering, you can begin to take advantage of exclusive workshops and communication master-classes developed to give you the right skills to get ahead.

3. As if that wasn&apos;t enough, as long as you complete 16+ hours of volunteering, HeadStart will set you up with a guaranteed interview for a paid part-time or seasonal job with leading employers, including Starbucks, New Look, Lloyds and many more.

Even if you donâ€™t land a job, the skills and experience gained by taking part in HeadStart will set you up for the future and look great on UCAS and future job applications! The next round of applications begin in Summer 2016.  Get in there first and express your interest today by filling in this short form.


We hope these opportunities interest you - please do get in touch with the Graduates Team if you&apos;d like any more information!

Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
