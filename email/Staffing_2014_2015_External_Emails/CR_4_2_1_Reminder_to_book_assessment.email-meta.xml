Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have noticed that you have not yet booked onto any of our group assessments for our 2016 seasonal roles.

What do I need to do?

Please head to the Booking Assessments page on the staffing website. Here you will:

View a list of possible assessment dates

Book onto an assessment

Review details of your chosen assessment

Submit an Alternative Dates Form* if you cannot make any of the dates offered to you.


*Please note: it is not always possible to offer you alternative assessment dates. We would recommend that you try to make yourself available for one of the initial dates offered to you where possible.

What else?

If you no longer wish to work on the NCS programme, please contact your local staffing team or email our general helpline (seasonalroles@the-challenge.org) to notify us of your withdrawal.

If you have any questions about our group assessments please contact your local staffing team. You can also find information on our assessments on our FAQs.

We look forward to meeting you!

Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
