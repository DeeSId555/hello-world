Dear {!Contact.Name},

Lunch will be provided; we can offer vegetarian options but unfortunately, we are unable to accommodate other specific dietary requirements. If you have specific dietary requirements please bring your own lunch.

The Challenge is an equal opportunities employer. If you have not already done so, please notify us of any disability or specific that you have that may require reasonable adjustment on our part during the training.



Please ensure that you check for any changes to the training details the night before. These will be updated on the &apos;Training Booking Details&apos; page no later than a day before the event.

What if I can no longer attend?

Please contact your local staffing team as soon as possible if you are unable to attend the training. We will endeavour to offer you an alternative training date, but unfortunately this may not always be possible.


Best wishes,

The Challenge
