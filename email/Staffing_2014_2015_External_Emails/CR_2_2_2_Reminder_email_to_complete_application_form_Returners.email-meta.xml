Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have noticed that you haven&apos;t completed and submitted your application for NCS summer 2016 yet. As an alumni member of staff, we&apos;d love to be able to work with you again this summer. In previous years, more than a third of our seasonal roles have been filled by returning staff, ensuring that each programme is of the same high quality as the last - we&apos;d like this to be the case again this year!

Why submit an application now?

We know just how much enthusiasm and dedication you brought to our previous NCS programme, and for this reason we want to be able to offer the best choice of roles and locations to our alumni. This year, we&apos;re growing yet again, with over 4,500 roles to fill, and new inclusion roles and locations to tempt you with!

We encourage candidates to submit their applications sooner rather than later. This means that you will have a greater selection of roles and locations to choose from in the summer.

Our upcoming deadline is the 28th of this month. Applications submitted before this date will be fast-tracked.

Click here to continue your application! https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fsecure%2f

If you have any questions about the application process, or are no longer interested in working with us, please get in touch on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.

We looking forward to receiving your application!

Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
