OUR SEASONAL PROGRAMMES

We run NCS programmes throughout the year - all of our seasonal programmes take place during school breaks, so our roles are perfect for teachers, support assistants and other school-based professionals.

The NCS seasonal programmes currently take place during February half-term, with some March weekends; during the summer holidays, from late June until early October; and during October half-term with some weekends in November.
