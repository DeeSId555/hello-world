Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

We hope that you had a great time on the programme! We have now processed payroll for your work{!Job_placement__c.Wave__c}.

Summary of your approved payroll for {!Job_placement__c.Wave__c}

Your gross pay is {!Job_placement__c.Total_Amount_Paid__c}. This payment covers a total of {!Job_placement__c.days_worked__c} days.

This payment constitutes your work between the dates of {!Job_placement__c.Assignment_start_date__c} and {!Job_placement__c.Assignment_end_date__c}.

There are two payment dates for this wave. You will receive an advance payment ahead of the formal pay date, and then the remaining pay on {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_payment_date__c}.

Advance payment dates

All seasonal staff working on this wave will receive an advance payment of 70% of their gross pay.

Your advance payment is {!Job_placement__c.Payroll_advance_owed__c}. This amount will not be subject to tax and National Insurance (NI) contributions, and you will not receive a payslip for this payment.

You can see all of this summer&apos;s advance payment dates on this document: https://staffing.the-challenge.org/assets/2016payroll-WhenwillIbepaidformyrole.pdf
