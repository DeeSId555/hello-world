What does the Practitioner assessment entail?

Our group Practitioner assessments are designed to test both your skills in your chosen area(s) (media, photography, music, drama, sport and enterprise) and your ability to facilitate and manage groups of young people.

In preparation for your assessment, we ask candidates to bring a five-minute workshop based on the skill you are being assessed for. More information on the workshop can be found under the event page once you have registered onto an assessment date.

Please also bring your passport or other form of photo ID.

Further information on booking onto an assessment can be found by clicking on the ‘info’ icons in the top right-hand corner of the page, and in section 4 of our FAQs.

We look forward to meeting you at an assessment soon!

Best wishes,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
