Dear {!Contact.FirstName}.



Thank you for completing your application for an Enhanced DBS certificate with GB Group for The Challenge. We have noticed that you submitted your application a week ago, but we have not received a notification from the Post Office that your documents have been verified.



What do I need to do?



You will need to take the ID documents you used for your application to the Post Office where they will be verified. You will also need to take the printed form from the GB Group application to be verified alongside your documents and scanned to GB Group by the Post Office.



This step must be taken within 13 days of submitting your DBS application. You have 5 days from receipt of this email to have your documents verified; after this point you will need to start the application process again.



Already completed this step? Please contact your local staffing team and we can look into this matter further. Please note that there may be a 24 hour delay between us being notified of your application, and your receipt of this email.



If you have any questions, or would like further information on the DBS application process, please contact your local staffing team quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence. Alternatively, review our FAQs.
Best wishes,
