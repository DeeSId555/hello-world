Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for uploading a copy of your DBS certificate to the Staffing Website. There has been a change to the status of your DBS that may require action.



What do I need to do?

Please login to the Staffing Website and access the Disclosure and Barring Service section under Essential Information. Your ‘DBS status’ will show what the update is and indicate any actions you may need to take.
