Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for booking onto one of our group assessments!



How to find out more about your assessment



To see the event details for your chosen assessment, please head to the Booking Assessments page on the staffing website and click on the title of your assessment. You will then be able to access:



Date and time of your assessment

Venue information

Documents you must bring to assessments

What you will need to prepare for assessment





Please check for any changes to this information the night before your assessment. Any updates to venue or date/time details will be uploaded to the staffing website no later than a day before the event.



Reasonable adjustments at assessment



If you have additional needs and require any reasonable adjustment at assessment on our part, please get in touch with the Inclusion Staffing team on inclusion.ss@the-challenge.org. Any information you disclose will be treated confidentially, and will not be used in any decision making in regards to your assessment.



What else?



The Challenge is an equal opportunities employer. If you have not already done so, please notify us of any disability that you have which may require reasonable adjustment on our part at assessment. This will not affect your application.



If you have any questions about the assessment, please contact your local staffing team. You can also find information on our group assessments on our FAQs.



We look forward to meeting you!
