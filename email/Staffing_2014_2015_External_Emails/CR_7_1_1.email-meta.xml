Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Invalid Number for Referee One - Requires immediate action.



We have encountered a problem with your referee one. The phone number you have provided for {!Job_Application__c.Referee_1__c} does not work.



This is the number you provided: {!Job_Application__c.Referee_1_tel__c}



What do I need to do?



With the programme fast approaching it is imperative that we obtain valid references in advance of your start date.



Please either update the reference details with a correct number or provide a new reference altogether on the Staffing Website.



If we are encountering problems with both of your references you will receive another email detailing that specific issue.



All or some of the references section has been unlocked for you to make changes to your referee(s) details.



For further assistance with your references section please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.
Best wishes,



The Challenge
