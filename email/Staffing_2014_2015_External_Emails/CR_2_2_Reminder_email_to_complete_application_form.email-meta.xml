Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have noticed that you haven&apos;t completed and submitted your application to work on the NCS programme.

We encourage candidates to submit their applications sooner rather than later. This means that you will have a greater selection of roles and locations to choose from in the summer.

Why should I finish my application?

We have over 4,500 roles to fill in 2016 - whether it&apos;s a leader, mentor, logistical, specialist or inclusion role, we&apos;re bound to have the right one for you!

Join us as a Senior Mentor and guide a team of young people through each week of the programme, or take on a practitioner role and inspire young people with your talent. Whichever role you choose, you can rest assured that you will be paid to have the summer of a lifetime, and that you will make a real difference to a group of young people and the wider community.

As a new candidate, you will need to come of one of our group assessments before we can offer you a role. Our assessments fill up quickly, so submit your application as soon as possible to make sure you don&apos;t miss out!

Our upcoming deadline is the 28th of this month. Applications submitted before this date will be fast-tracked.


Our application form is available in different formats!

If you have additional needs and require some assistance throughout the application process, we can make reasonable adjustments. We an provide the application form in a different format (for example in Braille or in the form of a phone conversation) and provide you with a confidential point of contact to help with your application. If you require any adjustments to be made, or would like more information about how we support seasonal staff with additional needs, please get in touch with the Inclusion Staffing Team on inclusion.ss@the-challenge.org. Any information you disclose will be treated confidentially, and will not be used in any decision making in regards to your application.

What else?

If you need any more information about the application process, or are no longer interested in working with us, please get in touch on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org or contact your local staffing team.

We look forward to receiving your application!
