Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Following your recent phone call with the Staffing Team, after reviewing your DBS we are unfortunately unable to offer you a place to work with us on the NCS programme. This decision is final and was made with reference to our strict policy guidelines on working with young people.



We thank you for your interest in The Challenge.
Best wishes,



The Challenge
