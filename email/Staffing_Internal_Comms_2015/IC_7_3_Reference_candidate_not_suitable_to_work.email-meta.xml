Hi,

Poor reference for {!Contact.Name}.

A referee for {!Contact.Name} has indicated on the online reference form that this candidate is not suitable to work with young people on the programme.

What do you need to do?

Review this JA link here : to see why the referee does not feel the candidate is suitable. If you feel there is enough information to make an informed decision, please do the following -

Call the candidate to explain why they are not suitable to work on the programme

Update the following field (field name) with â€˜rejected due to unacceptable references).

Once this field is updated a rejection email to the candidate will be triggered


Thanks,
Salesforce</textOnly>
