Dear Sherry and Matthew,


The candidate below has been invited to an assessment. In their application, they indicated that they have a disability or additional needs which may require reasonable adjustments on our part during the assessment.


Follow this link to their job application: {!Job_Application__c.Link}


Please ensure that you discuss the candidateâ€™s requirements at least one week before their assessment date in order to give enough time for adjustments to be put in place.


Thanks,


The Staffing Team
