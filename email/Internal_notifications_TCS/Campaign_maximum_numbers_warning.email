Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Please note that the number of graduates registered to attend {!Campaign.Name} now equals or exceed the maximum number of graduates the event is for.

It is standard TCS policy to allow a further 20% graduates to sign up to attend the event, to compensate for graduates who have signed up but do not turn up on the day. You will receive another notification when the overbooking maximum (120%) is reached.

This is an automatic alert, sent whenever campaign attendance registration reaches 100% or exceeds 100% for the first time.
