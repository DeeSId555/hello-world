    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.OwnerFirstName}

It has been two weeks since the Grad asked to withdraw from The Challenge Society and no action has been recorded. Please look at {!Contact.Name}&apos;s record and contact them to see if you can change their mind and find a way for them to remain with The Challenge Society. Click on this link to see the record: {!Contact.Link}

If you are able to change their mind, then please remove the date from the &apos;Date of YPPG withdrawal notification&apos; field.

If you are not able to change their mind, then please put their date of your conversation with them into the &apos;Withdrawal confirmed by Owner&apos; field, so that it is clear that they are definitely withdrawing. Please also note their reason for withdrawal.

This is a standard email, sent automatically whenever a Grad notifies us that they want to withdraw.</textOnly>
