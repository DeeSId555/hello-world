Dear {!Contact.Name}

Due to an error in our payroll input, last week we sent all Residential Mentors the incorrect payment information for their work on the NCS summer programme. Please accept our apologies for any confusion caused, and read on for information on your pay for each wave you have worked so far.


Residential Mentor payment schedule

Residential Mentors working on the &apos;tented village&apos; pilot waves are paid a daily rate of £75. This amounts to a total of £325 per wave (consisting of 5 working days). This total is subject to tax and National Insurance (NI) deductions.

The table below indicates when you will receive your pay.


Wave 2  - 28 July
Wave 3 - 28 July
Wave 4 - 11 August
Wave 5 - 11 August
Wave 6 - 8 September (advance 25 August)
Wave 7 - 8 September (advance 25 August)
Wave 8 - 8 September
Wave 9 - 8 September
Wave 10 - 8 September

Staff working on waves 6 and 7 will receive an advance payment of 70% on the 25 August. This is because of the extended wait between the work dates for these waves and the corresponding payroll date.?

N.B. If you were required to work an additional day  at the start of your Wave, you will be paid for this at the daily rate of £75 with the payroll for your first wave.


What next?

You will continue to receive ‘payment schedule’ and ‘payment notification’ emails (with the correct information this time!) for each of your remaining waves. These emails will detail the amount of pay you can expect for each wave.

If you have any questions about your payment for your role, please do not hesitate to contact us! Alternatively, you can look through our ‘Payment, Advances and Expenses’ FAQs.

Once again, we’d like to apologise for our error last week, and thank you for your work on the NCS programme so far!


Best wishes,

The Challenge
