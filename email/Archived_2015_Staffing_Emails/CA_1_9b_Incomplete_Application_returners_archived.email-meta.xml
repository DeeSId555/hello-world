Dear {!Contact.Name}


We are glad to see you have started an application to work with us in 2015. Each year as many as a third of our waves are staffed with returners – helping to ensure the continued excellent quality of the NCS programme.


Why should you complete your application now?



We have 30% more waves and new locations available and we want you to have the best possible choice of locations and dates to work. Our seasonal roles are filling up fast, and we are reaching the end of our recruitment period; we highly recommend getting your application in as soon as possible.



We prioritise alumni staff, but only once you have submitted applications and completed all the necessary pre-employment checks– so make sure you complete your application now!


Click here to continue your application


Our upcoming deadline is the 1st May. Applications submitted before this date will be fast-tracked and successful candidates will have a greater choice of assessment dates, if applicable.


Please contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org if you have any queries or if you are no longer interested in working with us. Please ensure you quote the email reference number below in any correspondence.


We look forward to receiving your completed application soon!



Best Wishes
