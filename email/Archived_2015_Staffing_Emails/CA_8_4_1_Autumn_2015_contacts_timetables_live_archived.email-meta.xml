Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope that you’re looking forward to starting your role on the NCS Autumn programme.

You can now login to the Staffing Website to view the timetable for your work dates on the ‘My Role’ section.

Here, you will also be able to ‘sign’ your contract online and download a copy for your own records.

Please note: if your role works over the NCS: Real Challenge Action (RCA) days of the programme, the work dates and venue information for this section will be available on a separate timetable.

If you feel that you are missing a timetable, please contact your Staffing Associate as soon as possible.

What else?

If you have not worked with us before, or if your personal details on the ‘Essential Information’ section has changed since your summer wave, please go back and ensure that we have all the correct health &amp; safety, bank &amp; tax and emergency contact information.

If you have any further questions about your role please do get in touch with your local staffing team. You can also view our FAQs for further information.

We look forward to seeing you on the programme!
Best wishes,


The Challenge
