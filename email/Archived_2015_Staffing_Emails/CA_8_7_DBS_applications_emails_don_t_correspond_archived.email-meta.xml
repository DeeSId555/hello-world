Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for beginning the DBS process in relation to your application to work on the NCS programme this year. We have become aware of an issue that means we are unable to associate some candidates DBS application with their job application on the staffing website. This is because the email addresses used for both processes are different. Thankfully there is a very simple solution so please follow the next steps to resolve!


What do I need to do?

Staff who have created an application with our partner organisation GB Group need to have used the same email address that they used for the Staffing application. This allows your GB Group application to correspond with your account on our system.

Please check which email address you used for both your Staffing application and your DBS application.

If they are not the same, please update your email address on your Staffing application under ‘My Profile’ to match your GB Group application.

Check your DBS status on the ‘Essential Information’ page a couple of days later - please note that there can be a delay of up to 48 hours in DBS status updates.

If your DBS status is still not updating correctly, please contact your local staffing team, who will be able to look into the issue further.



Any questions?

If you have any queries about your DBS application, or about your role in general, please contact your local staffing team quoting the email reference number below. You can also find information on our FAQs.


Best wishes,
