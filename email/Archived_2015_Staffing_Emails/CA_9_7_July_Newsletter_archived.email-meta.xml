THIS SUMMER SO FAR...

Phew! We&apos;re now halfway through the Summer 2015 programme, with wave 8 kicking-off next week. So far, over 6,000 young people have started or completed our programme, supported through three weeks of adventure and social action by our fantastic seasonal staff.

To get an idea of how the NCS programme, and the seasonal staff supporting it, are truly changing young people&apos;s lives, please read the story below.

&quot;E has autism and a combination of learning and communication disabilities. At NCS: Personal Challenge kick-off it took his parents an hour and a half to persuade his to get out of their car. During the first 24 hours E engaged well with his Support Worker and was supported by the young men in his dorm, but it became apparent very quickly that he actually needed two Support Workers.

Throughout the week, E shared a dormitory with other young people, and came into the dinner hall to eat his meals with the rest of his team. This was something his mum said that he wouldn&apos;t do. During her phone calls with E&apos;s Support Workers, E&apos;s mother has been overwhelmed by the level of the happy noises he&apos;s making.

E&apos;s parents are delighted with the progress he&apos;s made and the level of support he&apos;s received from both the young people on the wave and our staff team, and this is truly proving to be a transformational experience for both E and the young people working with him.&quot;

To all the seasonal staff who have already worked on a wave - thank you! We hope you&apos;ve had a great time on the NCS programme! If you&apos;re yet to start your wave, get ready - the programme so far has been more full-on and exciting than ever, an we can&apos;t wait to work with you too!

THANK YOU TO OUR RESERVE STAFF

Each year, we are extremely lucky to be able to count on a vast number of reserve staff. Our reserve workforce are often asked ot work at short notice and a huge number of them go the extra mile to ensure that each wave is to the same high standard as the last.

We want to take this chance to say thank you to our incredible reserve, especially for your patience as we reach the midpoint on the summer programme. If we haven&apos;t managed to place you on a wave just yet - don&apos;t worry. In previous years, 95% of reserve staff have been offered work throughout the summer programme, and we are doing our best to offer the same opportunities in 2015.

If you are part of our reserve staff, it&apos;s best to make sure that your Staffing Associate is absolutely clear on your availability and flexibility! Please ensure that you &apos;Choosing when I work&apos; and &apos;Dates I can&apos;t work&apos; sections on the Staffing Website are up-to-date, and keep in regular contact with your local staffing team.

September weekend work: We sometimes have additional work available covering NCS: Real Challenge Action weekends in September. If you are interested in working these, then please do Contact your local staffing team.



AUTUMN RECRUITMENT - OPEN SOON!

We may still only be half-way through the summer programme, but it&apos;s nearly time to start thinking about the upcoming Autumn 2015 programme too!

The Autumn programme will take place in October school half-term, with some staff required to work some weekend dates in November too. This opportunity is perfect for alumni staff who are looking to earn some money during their breaks from school or university. The condensed programme takes place over a single week and the Practitioner role is just a three day commitment!

As well as working with our alumni we will also be looking to recruit a number of new mentors, leaders and skills practitioners. Applications for new staff will go live in mid-August, so please do spread the word if you have friends and colleagues who may be interested.

We&apos;ll be in touch soon with more information about the Autumn programme, and how returning staff can register their interest and availability!

HELP US SPREAD THE WORD - STAFFING TESTIMONIALS

How has your summer with The Challenge been so far? What memorable stories do you have to tell? How have you changed as a person?

We&apos;re looking for testimonials from our seasonal staff to help us encourage even more people to sign up to work on our programmes, and we&apos;d love to hear about their experiences on the NCS programme.

Maybe one of the young people on your wave achieved something they never thought they could; or maybe you&apos;ve noticed your own confidence growing throughout the programme. Whatever your story is, send it to us and it might just end up in the next edition of the newsletter, and on our Seasonal Roles website!

Please send your testimonial to: seasonalroles@the-challenge.org, or share your experience on Twitter with @seasonalstaff, using the hashtag #MyChallenge.
