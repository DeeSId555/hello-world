Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for starting an application for a seasonal role on the NCS programmes. We have noticed that you have not yet completed your application, and are writing to advise you to submit it by our new deadline of 2nd August.


Why should you submit your application now?

If you submit your application earlier there will be a greater choice of assessment dates and roles available to you, should you be successful. Our roles will fill up very quickly so applying later will reduce your chances of gaining a placement on the programme.


What else?

You can now work on the NCS programme in Yorkshire! We have Autumn roles available in Leeds and Bradford - please make sure you select these areas on your application form in order to be considered for our new locations!

Our upcoming deadline is 2nd August. Applications submitted before this date will be fast-tracked.



Click here to go to your application



If you have any questions about the Autumn programme, or our new locations, please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.

We look forward to receiving your completed application soon!



Best Wishes
