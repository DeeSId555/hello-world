Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have been notified that your DBS certificate is listed and there is information we need to review prior to authorisation. All staff who work on our seasonal programmes must have valid and approved DBS certificates.

What do I need to do?

You should contact your Staffing Representative as soon as possible.

Your DBS certificate is being sent to you from the Disclosure and Barring Service. Once you receive it, please do the following:

Mail your original DBS certificate to us - Please post the copy to our Waterloo office (address below) for the attention of Abby Lamb.

Use &apos;Royal Mail Signed For&apos; delivery method - This ensures that your documents  are sent to us securely, and the Staffing Team will need to sign for your package. We will return your certificate by the same method.  Please ensure that you write the &apos;return&apos; address on the back of the envelope!


What happens next?

Your DBS will be reviewed by a Staffing Manager and we will update the DBS section on the Staffing Website. If we require further information we may contact you. We aim to review DBS certificates within a week of receiving them.


I have not received my DBS certificate yet

You will have received an email from GB Group notifying you that your DBS has been processed and is being returned to you. If you received this email more than 7 days ago and have not yet received your DBS, please contact the Disclosure and Barring Service as soon as possible and request for your certificate to be resent. If you fail to do this within 14 days of receiving your notification email, you will have to start your DBS application again.

If you have any further questions regarding your DBS application, please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.

Best wishes,
