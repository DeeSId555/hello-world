Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


We have contacted you about alternative dates for an assessment. However, you have notified us that you cannot currently attend any dates we have offered.


What do you need to do now?

Please contact me with updated information on your circumstances and schedule if you still wish to book on to an assessment.

Without an assessment your application cannot proceed any further and candidates who have attended assessment before you will take priority when roles are allocated.

If you have any questions please contact me, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.


Best Wishes

The Challenge
