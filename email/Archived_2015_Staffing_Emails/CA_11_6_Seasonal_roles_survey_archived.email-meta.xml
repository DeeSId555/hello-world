Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We&apos;d like to thank you for your hard work over the last year and invite you to provide us with some valued feedback of your experience with The Challenge and the NCS programme. Throughout 2015 we&apos;ve worked with over 3,500 staff members on our February, Summer and Autumn programmes. This has meant that over 27,000 young people have been able to take part in the NCS programme this summer alone!

This year each and every one of you have contributed to our largest and most successful staff intake, with record numbers of you receiving &apos;good&apos; or &apos;outstanding&apos; feedback for your work on the programme. We are committed to continuously improving the roles and opportunities we offer to our seasonal staff and, as valued Challenge alumni, we&apos;d like to take your experiences and opinions on board.

Please follow this link to the 2015 Seasonal Staff Survey:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/27DXPQJ

This survey gives you the opportunity to give us feedback on your role, and to make suggestions for how our seasonal roles should look next year. The survey should only take around 10-20 minutes to complete.

The deadline for submission is Monday the 9th of November. All submitted surveys will be automatically entered into a prize draw. The lucky winner will receive an Amazon voucher worth £100, and one runner-up will receive a £50 Amazon voucher!

Thanks again for working on the NCS programme(s) this year. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.


Best wishes,

The Staffing Team</textOnly>
