Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Incorrect Number for Referee One - Requires Immediate Action



We have encountered a problem with your referee one. The number you have provided for {!Job_Application__c.Referee_1__c} is not a direct line to the referee, and we have been unable to contact them.



This is the number you provided: {!Job_Application__c.Referee_2_tel__c}.



What do I need to do?



With the programme fast approaching it is imperative that we obtain valid references in advance of your start date.



Please either update the referee details with the correct/direct phone number or provide a new reference altogether on the Staffing Website



If we are encountering problems with both of your references then you will receive another email detailing that specific issue.



All or some of the references section has been unlocked for you to make changes to your referee(s) details.



For further assistance with your references section please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.
Best wishes,



The Challenge
