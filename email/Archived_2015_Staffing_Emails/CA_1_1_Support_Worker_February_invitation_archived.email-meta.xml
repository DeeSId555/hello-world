Dear [Contact Name]


I hope you are well and are enjoying the holiday season. Our new NCS February programme is on the horizon and it would be great to have you on board again.


What is the NCS February programme?


Our NCS February programme is a condensed version of the NCS summer programme which runs over the February half term and three following weekends. It is the same intense and rewarding programme for young people who did not have an opportunity to join us over the summer.


What are the dates for the programme?

NCS: Personal Challenge - 14-17 February (residential)

NCS: Team Challenge - 18-20 February (non-residential)

NCS: Real Challenge - 28 Feb - 1 March, 7 &amp; 14 March (non-residential)



The pay for the Support Worker role will be £935 for 11 days’ work with us.


I am interested, what do I have to do?


- Enter your availability in our February Programme Interest Form - deadline for submission is 12th January. Please submit your interest early to avoid disappointment as there are limited number of roles available.

Click here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HHXJVNX

- Submit a new 2015 application so that we have an up-to-date record of all your Support Worker skills*

- You will not need to attend an assessment to carry out the Support Worker role but you will need to attend a compulsory two-hour training** session for the February Programme.


*If you are not available for February but are interested in working in summer/autumn please still submit an application as soon as possible.

** Training dates will be confirmed in mid-Jan.

.

When will I find out if I am working?


We will receive information on young people who require additional support in early January. Once we have this information we will start to match candidates in January. All staff who express an interest will be contacted by Alice (London) and Becky (North-West England and West Midlands).


If you have any questions regarding the February Programme, please contact supportworkers@the-challenge.org quoting the email reference below in any correspondence.


Thank you again for your continued support of The Challenge and we wish you a Happy New Year!
Best Wishes


NCS with The Challenge
