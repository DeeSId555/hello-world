Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope that you’ve had a great summer - we definitely have! The 2015 Summer programme is now finishing up, but we still have some great opportunities for you to get involved in throughout September, October and November.


The NCS Autumn Programme - 25th August Deadline

A couple of weeks ago we asked you to update your availability for Autumn on the Staffing Website. We’ve had a huge response so far - if you’ve already told us your availability for Autumn, thank you! If you haven’t yet had a chance to update your availability, but know that you would like to work with us again during October and November, please do so by the 25th of August!

We use the availability of our summer staff to calculate how many new staff we will recruit for Autumn. As such, if you do want to work then letting us know before the above deadline will mean we are much more likely to have space for you in October!

The Autumn programme runs over the school October half-term, with some roles working two weekend dates in November. Please refer to this document to see which work dates are available for your role:

Click here to update your availability on the Staffing Website: https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fsecure%2f


Once we have collected your availability, your local staffing team will be in touch to discuss possible work placements!


Any questions?

If you have any queries about the autumn programme, please do get in touch with your local staffing team. You can also find general information about the Autumn programme on our FAQs page.


We look forward to working with you again soon!


Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
