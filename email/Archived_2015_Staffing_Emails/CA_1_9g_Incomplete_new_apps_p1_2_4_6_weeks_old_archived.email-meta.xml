Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for starting an application for a seasonal role on the NCS programme. We are writing to advise you to complete your application by our 1st May deadline.




Why should you submit your application now?


If you submit your application by 1st May there will be:


a greater choice of assessment dates

Roles are filling fast as we reach the end of our recruitment period, so we highly recommend getting your application is as soon as possible! Some of our roles are likely to be full in certain areas or for certain dates imminently.


Applications submitted on or before 1st May will be fast-tracked and this will increase your options should you be successful at assessment.

What happens if I miss the deadline?



As you started your application some time ago, if your application is still not complete after 4th May, we will put it on hold. This means that, unless we hear from you, we will assume that you are no longer interested in working on the programme.


Please contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org if you have any queries or if you are no longer interested in working with us. Please ensure you quote the email reference number below in any correspondence.
