Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations! Based on your recent assessment with The Challenge, we’d like to provisionally offer you the role of {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}.

Why have I been offered this role?

This might not be the role you originally applied for, but during your assessment you demonstrated the skills and experience necessary for the {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c} role, and we think you’d be a great candidate. We hope that you feel able to accept!

What happens now?

Your programmes team will be in touch soon to talk you through the next steps you need to take! Unlike our other seasonal role candidates, you will not need to fill out the rest of the sections on the Staffing Website.

Well done again on your successful assessment and we look forward to working with you this summer!

Best wishes,

The Challenge
