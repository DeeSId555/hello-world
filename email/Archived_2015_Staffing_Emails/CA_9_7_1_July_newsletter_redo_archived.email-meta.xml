THIS SUMMER SO FAR...

Phew! We&apos;re now nearing the end of our Summer 2015 programme, with wave 9 kicking-off next week. So far, over 6,000 young people have started or completed our programme, supported through three weeks of adventure and social action by our fantastic seasonal staff.

To all the seasonal staff who have already worked on a wave - thank you! We hope you&apos;ve had a great time on the NCS programme! If you&apos;re yet to start your wave, get ready - the programme so far has been more full-on and exciting than ever, and we can&apos;t wait to work with you too!

AUTUMN RECRUITMENT UPDATE

The Summer programme may be well under-way, but it&apos;s already time to start thinking about the Autumn 2015 programme too!

The Autumn programme will take place in October school half-term, with some staff required to work some weekend dates in November too. This opportunity is perfect for alumni staff who are looking to earn some money during their breaks from school or university. The condensed programme takes place over a single week, with varying start dates and role lengths!

Autumn recruitment for our new Yorkshire region is already in full swing, so makwe your way to www.ncsthechallenge.org/seaonalroles now if you want to register your interest. For other regions, applications will go live in mid-August, so please do keep an eye out on our jobs page and spread the word if you have friends or colleagues who may be interested.

For alumni working this summer, we&apos;ll be in touch imminently with more information about how to update your availability for Autumn without having to start a new application. Watch this space!

HELP US SPREAD THE WORD - STAFF TESTIMONIALS

With the Summer programme ticking along nicely we want to take some time to collect and share some of our best experiences as staff members working on the NCS programme.

Whether you&apos;ve worked this summer or you are part of our alumni staff from way back when, we want to hear from you!

Maybe one of the young people on your wave achieved something they never thought they could, or maybe you&apos;ve noticed your own confidence growing throughout the programme. Whatever your story is, don&apos;t let it be lost! Send it to us and it might just end up in the next edition of the newsletter, or on our Seasonal Roles website!

Please send your testimonial to: seasonalroles@the-challenge.org, or share your experience on Twitter with @seasonalstaff, using the hashtag #MyChallenge.
