Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

This is a final reminder that our application deadline of 2nd March is fast approaching.

We have already offered over 1500 roles for the summer which means we are almost halfway there! This huge amount of interest does mean that some of our roles are likely to be full in certain areas or for certain dates imminently.

Submitting your application this weekend will mean we can fast-track you through our recruitment process.

What this means for you!

Your application will be reviewed within two weeks
You will benefit from a greater choice of assessment dates

and most importantly....

If you are offered a position, you will have your pick of the dates and locations before they fill up altogether!
