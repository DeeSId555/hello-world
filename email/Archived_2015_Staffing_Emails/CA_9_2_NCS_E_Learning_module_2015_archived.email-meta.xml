Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

In preparation for the programme, the NCS Trust asks all seasonal staff who have been offered a role to complete an NCS E-Learning module. The aim of this module is to give you a better understanding of the principles that underpin the ethos of NCS.


What do I need to do?

To access the E-Learning module please click here.

If you have not worked on the NCS programme  before, please register with an email address and create a password, select the &quot;Summer&quot; programme from the drop down menu and select the local authority where you will be working.

If you completed the E-learning module last year, please login using the same email and address and password as before. Click on the &quot;Edit&quot; Button, choose the &quot;Programme&quot; drop down menu and click &quot;Summer&quot;. Then press &quot;submit&quot; and click &quot;Launch programme&quot;.

When logging in to this, if you are not sure which local authority to state, please put the local authority that you originally applied for. For a full list of local authorities where we work, please see our FAQs.


Any questions?

If you have any questions about the E-Learning module, or about your role in general, please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.

We realise that some seasonal staff who receive this email will not have been given a confirmed work placement yet - please contact your Staffing Associate if you&apos;d like to discuss your availability, and please do complete the E-Learning module in the meantime. Thank you!



Best wishes,
