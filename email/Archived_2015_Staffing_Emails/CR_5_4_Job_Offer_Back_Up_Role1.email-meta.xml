Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Congratulations! Following your assessment we are delighted to offer you a role with us this summer as a {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}.

In the interest of fairness, we offer our seasonal roles on a first come, first served basis. Unfortunately, we have currently filled all of our roles for the upcoming seasonal programme, but would like to offer you a place on our back-up staff.

Our back-up staff are vital to the success of the NCS programme.

With such a large workforce, we experience a drop-out rate as high as 15% in some roles. As a result, more roles will become available over the coming months. In previous years, all of our back-up staff have been offered work. Therefore, if we cannot allocate you to a role immediately, you will be offered a role as soon as one becomes available.


What do I need to do now?

This offer is dependent on the following criteria. The sooner you complete the steps below the greater chance you will have of being placed in a role:


DBS certificate

All staff must produce an ‘Enhanced DBS certificate with Barred List check’ dated after 31 January 2014. You can either upload an existing DBS certificate* or apply for a new DBS certificate through GB Group through the Staffing Website.

Instructions and directions for the DBS application website can be found on the Staffing Website. Please read these instructions carefully before starting your application. Please use the ‘Organisation Pin’ and ‘Secret Word’ below to start your GB Group application.

Organisation Pin: 139135
Secret Word: TCNCS15

*To check if your existing Enhanced DBS fits The Challenge’s requirements, please refer to FAQ 6.3.


References

You will need to to provide contact details for two referees. We will contact these referees to confirm your suitability to work with young people. Please make sure your referees are willing to be contacted by us before submitting their information.


Essential Information

Each section of the Essential Information page should be completed at least one week before your start date. This includes bank and tax details, health and safety information, emergency contact details and inclusion information. This information may be shared with relevant partner organisations (e.g. outdoors activity venues, catering companies) where necessary.


Availability

You will be able to submit your preferred work dates in the ‘Choosing when I can work’ section. If there are any dates you can’t work throughout the summer, please include them in the ‘Dates when I can’t work’ section. Based on this information, the Staffing Team will try to match you to vacant roles that fit with your availability.


Training

Training is an important and compulsory part of all our seasonal roles and we cannot allow you to work on the NCS programme without it. You can book yourself onto the relevant training session on the ‘Booking Training’ page.


We will call you in the upcoming weeks to discuss back-up roles and talk through any questions you may have.

In the meantime, if you have any questions please contact me quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence or alternatively, look at our FAQs.

Thank you for your patience - we hope to be able to offer you a confirmed role on the programme soon.

Best wishes,

The Challenge
