Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for submitting an application to work on the NCS programme.

I&apos;m hoping to work in Summer 2015.

Unfortunately, we are now at an advanced stage of our recruitment cycle and our seasonal roles for summer are full. As a result we are unable to process your application in time for this intake. However, you will be considered for our Autumn programme.

Tell me more...

The NCS programmes donâ€™t just take place over summer - your application will be considered for the Autumn and Spring programmes, which take place during the October and February half-terms.

In Yorkshire our Autumn recruitment is well under-way so you should expect to hear back from our staffing associates within 3 weeks of completing your application. For all other regions, recruitment will begin shortly and we will be in touch in due course. If you have any questions regarding our seasonal programmes then do get in touch on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.


Again, thank you for taking the time to fill out an application, and for your interest in The Challenge and the NCS programme.

Best wishes,
The Challenge
