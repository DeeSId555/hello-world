Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for submitting an application to work on the NCS Summer Programme 2015. Unfortunately, we have now finished recruiting for all of our seasonal roles, and regret that we will be unable to work with you this summer.

We’d like to apologise for any delay in responding to your application. We have received an extremely large number of applications for our programme this year, and all of our roles have now been filled. However, if you are still interested in working with us in the future we do have upcoming opportunities.


How else can I get involved?

Work on our Autumn and Spring 2015 programmes

Applications for our other 2015 seasonal programmes will open soon. These programmes take place during the October and February half-terms and are shorter versions of our Summer programme, lasting just a week with some weekend dates in November or March. We’ll be in touch when our applications open again - you won&apos;t be required to fill out another application form. If you think you’d like to work in the Autumn or the Spring, please do look out for our email!

Volunteer with us! (South-London based)

Although our paid seasonal roles have been filled, we are still looking for Project Volunteers to help teams of young people to deliver their campaigns and Social Action Projects in September. This unpaid role works over September weekends and is perfect for those who want to gain experience working with young people. Please note that is opportunity is only available in London. For more information on the Project Volunteer role, please contact Roman Lagnado on roman.lagnado@the-challenge.org.


Thank you again for taking the time to submit an application, and for your interest in The Challenge and the NCS Programme. We hope to work with you in the future.


Best wishes,

The Challenge
