Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope that you’re ready for the start of NCS summer 2015! There are a few urgent things we need you to do on the Staffing Website before your summer can begin - please read on.


Contracts now live!

Your contract(s) for your role this summer is now available on the Staffing Website! Head to the ‘My Role’ section to read, download your own copy, and respond to your contract.

You must respond to your contract before your start date. You will receive a separate contract and timetable for each work placement or ‘wave’ you do with us this summer - this means you could receive up to nine contracts to sign. Please ensure that you respond to each one.

If you have any questions about your contract, please contact your local staffing team.


DBS applications

If you haven’t already started your DBS application with GB Group, now is the time to do so! The application process can take over 4 weeks to complete, and you must have your approved certificate before your start date.

To start an application for your DBS certificate, follow the link to the GB Group website on the Disclosure and Barring Service section of ‘Essential Information’.

If you have an existing Enhanced DBS certificate (with Children’s Barred List check), you can upload it to the Disclosure and Barring Service section to be approved. Remember that you will need to bring the original &apos;existing&apos; certificate to training to be witnessed.

Please note that if your certificate (new or existing) has listings, it will need to be approved by the Staffing managers. This process can take up to an additional two weeks.



Last minute ‘Essential Information’

With the first wave of our summer programme starting in only a few weeks it’s time to check that you have completed all of your ‘Essential Information’ section.

Bank Information: Head to the Staffing Website and check that you have provided us with the correct bank information - we will be inputting staff onto our payroll system shortly.

Tax declarations: Please also check that you have entered the correct tax information and that any P45 forms have been shared with us. Please note that if you worked with us on the February programme, you will need to resubmit your tax declaration. Unfortunately, we cannot help with any tax queries; to check if the information you have submitted is correct please consult the HMRC website.

Health &amp; Safety information: This information needs to be as up-to-date as possible. Please ensure that you complete this section and update it with any changes up to your start date. If you require any ‘reasonable adjustments’ whilst on the programme, please detail these as clearly as possible - you may be contacted by either Staffing or your Programmes team for further information.

Emergency contact information: Please ensure that the details you have provided for your emergency contact are up-to-date. Please only provide contact details for someone who will be in the country whilst you are on the programme, and who has an understanding of any medical or health &amp; safety needs you may have.


What else?

As always, please ensure that all the information you submit to the Staffing Website is as up-to-date and relevant as possible, and keep on updating the ‘Choosing when I can work’ and ‘Dates when I cannot work’ sections if you know of any changes to your availability. Please note if you are no longer available for any days of your work-schedules you must contact your Staffing Associate as soon as possible.

You will be sent the link to an ‘E-Learning Module’ via email shortly - this module is designed to give you an understanding of The Challenge’s values and the principles that underpin NCS. Please complete this module before you start your role.



Any questions?

If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence. Alternatively, you can find more information on the ‘Essential Information’ section on our FAQs.



Best wishes,
