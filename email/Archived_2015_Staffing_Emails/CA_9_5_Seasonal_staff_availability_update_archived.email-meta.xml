Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope that you are looking forward to the summer, and if you have already attended training for your role, that you found it both enjoyable and useful!

The first wave of Summer 2015 has finally kicked-off, and the Staffing Team is still working hard to match our seasonal staff to available work placements. We want to work with you as much as possible throughout the summer programme; in order to allocate you to the right work placements we need to know your correct availability over the coming months.


What do I need to do?

Please login to the Staffing Website and head to the &apos;Choosing when I can work&apos; and &apos;Dates when I can&apos;t work&apos; pages. Here, you will be able to see the dates of each wave and select which ones you&apos;d like to be considered for, and submit individual days which you will be unavailable for.

Follow this link to the Staffing Website: https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fsecure%2f

Please note that updating your availability on the Staffing Website will not affect your placement on any waves your Staffing Associate has already allocated you to. You may have told us over the phone when you are free, but there is more chance of us placing you if you complete this on our system too!

Please update this information by Friday 3rd July. Should you need to make changes to your availability after this, you will need to contact your Staffing Associate directly.



Any questions?

If you have any questions about the summer programme, or would like to discuss your availability with your Staffing Associate, please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence. Alternatively, you can find information in our FAQs.


Best wishes,

The Challenge
