Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have become aware that an email was sent in error recently regarding invitation to assessment. We have been having some systems issues, and it seems that this email was inadvertently sent to some individuals, such as yourself, who have already attended assessment this year.

Please disregard the email and apologies for any confusion this has caused.

Thank you for your interest in The Challenge and the NCS programme.


Best wishes,

The Challenge
