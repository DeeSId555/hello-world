Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your patience over the last few weeks. The process for matching Support Workers and Personal Coaches is an intricate one, and is dependent upon a number of factors including needs, specialisms, location and availability. Unfortunately this does mean that, inevitably, there are occasions when we are not able to offer every candidate a role on the programme. We regret that this is one such occasion, as we no longer have any full-length Support Worker or Personal Coach roles left within your availability, and will therefore not be able to offer you any full waves with us on the 2015 Summer programme.

Please accept our full apologies - we really appreciate your interest and enthusiasm for the NCS programme, and we&apos;re so sorry that we have been unable to work with you this season.

However, we do have some more short-term opportunities coming up over the next few weeks. Please read on for more information.



Back-up and Ad-hoc placements - waves 9 &amp; 10

There are still two waves of the Summer programme left, and we are anticipating several ad-hoc placements to become available. We are keen to have as many Support Workers and Personal Coaches available as emergency back-up staff as possible for these spaces.

The work dates for these waves are:

Wave 9: 10 August to 27 August
Wave 10: 15 August to 30 August

If you have any availability during these periods, and would like to be considered for ad-hoc work on the final two waves, please do let us know the exact dates you are able to work by emailing alice.mcfarlane@the-challenge.org.



September NCS: Real Challenge Action (RCA) weekends

Each year, we have a number of extra roles available during September as some young people might require extra support, or some Support Workers may be unable to work. We are dependent on reserve Support Workers and Personal Coaches to support these young people so that they can successfully complete the programme.

This work involves supporting a young person during the final part of the NCS programme. Over the September weekends, teams of young people take to the streets to campaign for their social action projects. This is a great opportunity to see how the programme has changed young people&apos;s perceptions of their local communities through NCS. There is the potential of up to 8 days of work throughout September weekends.

RCA for each wave takes place each Saturday and Sunday throughout September. Ad hoc support staff will be paid the standard Support Worker and Personal Coach daily rate of Â£85.

If you&apos;d like to be considered for September work, please get in touch with Alice: alice.mcfarlane@the-challenge.org.



2015 NCS Autumn programme

We are now recruiting for our upcoming Autumn programme. You will have already received an email inviting you to update your availability on the Staffing Website. Please follow the instructions on our last email (ref number CA 9.5b) and select your preferred Autumn wave as soon as possible.

Once we have collected your availability, we will be in touch with more information about possible placements.



Any questions?

Once again, we&apos;d like to apologise for our lack in roles this summer. If you have any questions about the September RCA weekends or the Autumn programme, please do get in touch.



Best wishes,

Alice McFarlane
