A FANTASTIC FEBRUARY PROGRAMME

2015 saw the launch of our first February NCS programme - to all the brilliant alumni staff who worked, thank you for bringing your enthusiasm, dedication and expertise!

Over 450 young people across the nation came together for a week of adventure, fun and community building. Over the next couple of weeks our young people will continue to carry out their social action projects and make their marks on their local communities. This would not be possible without the on-going support of our seasonal staff, especially those dedicating their weekends to the NCS programme!

TELL YOUR FRIENDS - APPLICATIONS ARE STILL OPEN!

We’re still looking for enthusiastic, skilled and experienced individuals to work on our exciting and intense summer 2015 programme. Help us spread the word so that your friends, family and colleagues don’t miss out - please feel free to forward this newsletter on to anyone who you think may be interested!

The 2015 application form is super easy and quick to fill out - and it even remembers information from your previous application; why wait to sign up for the summer of a lifetime? To start an application and discover which role is best for you this year, check out our Staffing Website!

NCS ADVERTS ON THE TV!

In January the NCS Trust launched a nationwide advertising campaign called ‘Our Future’, featured on billboards, online adverts and on the telly! The campaign encourages young people to speak up, get involved and make a difference by signing up for the NCS programmes.

If you haven’t seen the fantastic TV adverts yet, check out the full version here!
