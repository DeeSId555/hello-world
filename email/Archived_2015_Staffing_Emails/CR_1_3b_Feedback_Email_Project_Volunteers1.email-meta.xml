Dear {!Contact.Name}



Many thanks for your contribution on the NCS with The Challenge Programme.

Our applications are now open and we would like you to apply to work with us again. We would also like to take this opportunity to provide feedback about your performance over the programme and suggest suitable roles for 2015.



Why do I have feed back?
