Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for starting an application for a seasonal role on the NCS programmes. We are currently in the process of screening applications, and have already invited more than 1000 candidates to assessments.


Why should you submit your application now?

We have noticed that you have not yet completed your application, and we would encourage you to submit a full application to us sooner rather than later.


If you submit your application earlier there will be, a greater choice of assessment dates, roles and locations will be available to you, should you be successful. Our roles will fill up very quickly so applying later will reduce your chances of gaining a placement on the programme.


Our upcoming deadline is the 28th of this month. Applications submitted before this date will be fast-tracked.
