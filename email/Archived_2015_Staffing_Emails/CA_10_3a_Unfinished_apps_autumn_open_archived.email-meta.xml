Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Applications for the NCS Autumn programme are now open! We’ve noticed that you have previously started an application for our seasonal roles but have not yet finished it. This autumn we have several short-term work opportunities throughout October and November for the following roles:

Programme Leaders
Assistant Programme Leaders
Senior Mentors
Practitioners (of Music, Drama, Art, Sport, Media, Photography and Enterprise)


To see the full job descriptions for each of our seasonal roles, including the possible work dates for the Autumn programme, please click here:
 http://www.ncsthechallenge.org/seasonal-roles


Why should I submit my application now?

You’ll have a greater choice of work dates and locations the sooner you complete and submit your application. Due to the condensed length of the Autumn programme, we will have far fewer roles and opportunities available than we did in the summer - applying later will inevitably reduce your chances of working on the Autumn programme!

Our upcoming deadline is 30 August. Applications submitted before this date will be fast-tracked.

Click here to continue your application: https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fsecure%2f

Please contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org if you have any queries, or if you are no longer interested in working with us. Please ensure you quote the email reference number below in any correspondence.

We look forward to receiving your application soon!


Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
The Challenge
