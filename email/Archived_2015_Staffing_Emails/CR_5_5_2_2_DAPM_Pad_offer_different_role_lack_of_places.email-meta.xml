Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations! Following your recent assessment with us, weâ€™d like to offer you a role this summer as a {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}.

Why have I been offered this role?

The skills and experience you demonstrated at assessment make you a great candidate for the {!Job_Application__c.Calibre_of_candidate__c}role, and while we would have liked to have offered you this role, we do not currently have any work placements available.

However, we thought that you would be an equally strong candidate for the {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}, role, and hope that you feel able to accept.

What happens now?

Your programmes team will be in touch soon to talk you through the next steps you need to take!

Well done again on your successful assessment, and we hope to work with you in the summer.

Best wishes,

The Challenge
