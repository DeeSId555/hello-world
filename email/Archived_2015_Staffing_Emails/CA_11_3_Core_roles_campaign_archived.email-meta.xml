Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



The Challenge is growing!



We wanted to get in touch with you again to further highlight a number of permanent roles we are recruiting for at The Challenge. Unfortunately we have had a technical problem on our website, apologies if you were not able to apply for this reason. We have consequently extended the deadline on these roles to Monday 5th October.



Roles are now available to view on our NCS website.



A role for you?



Staffing Coordinator:

Work in the Staffing team as a coordinator, assisting with the planning and execution of seasonal staff assessments, ensuring each candidate’s completion of DBS checks, Right To Work and references, and assisting with relationship management with staff members. Responsibilities also include responding to candidates’ enquiries through the Staffing phone line.



A great coordinator will be highly organised, with excellent time management and communication skills.



Staffing Associate:

Join the Staffing department in recruiting for and filling our 2016 seasonal roles to support the NCS programme. Responsibilities include building relationships and presenting to a wide range of audiences, screening applications for seasonal roles, assessing candidates and managing relationships with staff, and allocating seasonal staff to support teams of young people on the programme.



Candidates should have excellent written and oral communication skills, the ability to work in a demanding and fast-paced environment, and outstanding organisation skills.




To see full details of these roles, and for guidance on how to apply, please go to our NCS Website.  The revised deadline is Monday 5th October. For more information on any of our roles, please contact our general helpline on 0203 542 2404 or email info@the-challenge.org.
