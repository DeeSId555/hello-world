Your training session

Lunch will be provided; we can offer vegetarian options but unfortunately, we are unable to accommodate other specific dietary requirements. If you have specific dietary requirements please bring your own lunch.

The Challenge is an equal opportunities employer. If you have not already done so, please notify us of any disability or specific that you have that may require reasonable adjustment on our part during the training.


What if I can no longer attend this date?

Please contact your local staffing team as soon as possible if you are unable to attend the training. We will try to offer you an alternative training date, but unfortunately this may not always be possible.

If you have any further questions please get in contact, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.


Best wishes,

The Challenge
