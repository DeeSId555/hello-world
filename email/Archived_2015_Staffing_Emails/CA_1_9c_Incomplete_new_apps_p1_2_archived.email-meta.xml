Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for starting an application for a seasonal role on the NCS programmes. We are writing to advise you to complete your application by our new deadline of 1st February.

Why should you submit your application now?

If you submit your application by 1st February there will be:

· a greater choice of assessment dates
· a greater choice of locations and dates available if we are able to offer you are role


We have already invited 1500 people to our assessments. Some of our roles are likely to be full in certain areas or for certain dates imminently.

Our upcoming deadline is 1st February. Applications submitted before this date will be fast-tracked and this will increase your options should you be successful at assessment.
