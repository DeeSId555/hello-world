Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting an application to work on the Autumn NCS programme and for your patience in awaiting our response.

Over the last couple of months we have received a huge number of applications from candidates hoping to join us for our Autumn programme. After holding a number of assessments we have subsequently hired almost all of the required new seasonal staff for this particular programme.

We have a very small number of vacancies left in some locations for certain roles. We will contact you directly by the 17th October if we are able to offer you an interview, but unfortunately most roles are now full.

Please be assured that this does not mean that your application was unsuccessful! Your application will still be screened for our future programmes. As always, we will be recruiting extensively for our summer programme which runs from late June to late August. Screening for this programme will take place from December onwards.

Thank you again for taking the time to submit an application, and for your interest in the NCS programme. We hope to work with you in the future!


Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
