Dear {!Contact.Name},

The NCS summer programme is fast approaching and we are still incredibly keen for our best leaders from previous years to get involved!

Although our records show that you are yet to apply to work on the programme in 2015, we hope that we may have come up with a flexible solution to make NCS more accessible for you this summer.

Tell me more!

The NCS programme, and all the young people who take part, benefit hugely from the experience of good quality returning staff. At the same time we recognise that we can ask for a lot from our seasonal staff in terms of time commitment and flexibility, and that some of you may not have been able to reapply this year due to other commitments. With this in mind, this summer we are trialing the idea of having 1-week cover periods for our PLs and APLs.

In order to do this, we need to know how many of our alumni leaders would be interested in joining the programme on a cover-basis with a decreased level of time commitment.

Sounds great - what do I need to do?

If you think this sounds like a great opportunity for you, please get in touch with the relevant staffing team below, stating your availability and preferred locations, quoting the email reference number (below).
