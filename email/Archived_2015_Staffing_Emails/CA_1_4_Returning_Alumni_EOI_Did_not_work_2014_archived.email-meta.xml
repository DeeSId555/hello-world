Dear {!Contact.FirstName}



Work with us again!

Our summer and autumn programmes 2014 gave a life-changing experience to over 19,500 young people. We couldn&apos;t have offered this fantastic opportunity to so many young people without the immense help of our seasonal staff members. Each year we are lucky to have a large number of our staff returning to work on the programme as alumni.



NCS with The Challenge is set to grow even larger in 2015, aiming to reach out to over 25,000 young people, and recruit up to 3,500 roles - we want you to be a part of this!



Why should I come back?



Alumni are important to the programme because you:

Impart knowledge from your previous experience to new staff.

Share skills you have developed, and use them to inspire and motivate young people.

Use your enthusiasm to make the programme an experience of a lifetime for both staff and young people.




I&apos;m in! How do I re-apply?



You will have to complete an application form on our new Staffing Website. The new website will allow you to manage your information more easily and submit all the necessary information needed before starting your role.

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fsecure%2f



As alumni you will already have a profile in our system; your login details are below.



Username: {!Contact.Email}

Password: {!Contact.Login_Password__c}



Once you have logged in, simply change your password, update your profile and begin your application!




I&apos;ve submitted a new application, now what?



You will need to reassess for a 2015 seasonal role, as the roles have changed significantly since you last worked with us. We will be in touch within two weeks to let you know the outcome of your application.



If you have any questions please contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.



We hope to receive an application from you soon!


Best Wishes



NCS with The Challenge
