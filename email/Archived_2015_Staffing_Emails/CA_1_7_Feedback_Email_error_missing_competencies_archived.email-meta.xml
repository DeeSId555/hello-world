Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

We recently emailed you about your performance over the NCS programmes. We wanted to give comprehensive feedback to all of our high quality staff, so that they would have the opportunity to further develop their skills and return to work on the NCS programme in 2015 with a greater understanding of their own abilities and skills.

Unfortunately, the feedback email we sent you was missing some or all of your detailed performance information. We regret to say that we are unable to provide any further information on your detailed feedback, and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.


Why did I not receive all my feedback?

Your detailed performance feedback was incomplete because we were unable to collect the relevant, or enough, information. This was due to one of the following:

The duration of your employment was too short and therefore we could not gather enough information for comprehensive feedback.

The individual providing your feedback does not have the capacity to source this information.


What should I do now?

The overall feedback and our recommendations for the 2015 NCS programmes remain the same, and we hope that you choose to work with us again.

If you have any queries about this or any further questions about the NCS programme please email The Challenge on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org quoting the email reference below in any correspondence.


Many thanks again for your contribution to the NCS programme and we look forward to hearing from you!


Best Wishes

The Challenge
