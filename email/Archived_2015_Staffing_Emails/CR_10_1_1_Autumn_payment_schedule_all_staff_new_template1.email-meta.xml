You are contracted to work on the NCS programme from {!Job_placement__c.Assignment_start_date__c} to {!Job_placement__c.Assignment_end_date__c} (&quot;Work Period&quot;), with {!Job_placement__c.Annual_Leave_entitlement__c} days (&quot;Holiday Period&quot;)] together referred to as a Wave Contract (a &quot;Wave Contract&quot;).

All payment amounts are calculated on the basis that you will work all days required of your role; any days of half days that you are absent or no longer required to work will be deducted from your pay.

All of your pay will be subject to tax and National Insurance (NI) deductions. You will be able to review tax deductions on your payslip which is sent to you via email two days prior to your payment date. The Challenge is unable to answer or help with any tax queries; if you are concerned about your tax code, please contact HMRC directly.
