Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



We have encountered a problem with your Referee One. This requires immediate action.



We have contacted {!Job_Application__c.Referee_1__c}, and they feel that they are unable to provide a reference confirming your suitability to work on the programme.



What do I need to do?



With the programme fast approaching it is imperative that we obtain valid references in advance of your start date. Please provide new referee details on the Staffing Website.



If we are encountering problems with both of your references then you will receive another email detailing that specific issue.



All or some of the references section has been unlocked for you to make changes to your referee(s) details.



For further assistance with your references section please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.
Best wishes,



The Challenge
