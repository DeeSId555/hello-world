Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



You were recently sent an email from us inviting you to update your availability on the Staffing Website for the Autumn programme. This email was sent to you in error, as we unfortunately do not offer the Residential Mentor, Community Facilitator or Senior Community Facilitator roles during the Autumn programme.



Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience or confusion caused. We are still recruiting for a number of roles this Autumn with applications opening in mid-August, so if you fancy trying your hand at another position then please do apply through our website as normal!



As always, applications for our 2016 seasonal programmes open in December, and we will be in touch with all current and alumni staff nearer the time with information on how to register your interest.



If you have any questions, please do get in contact with your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below.





Best wishes,



The Staffing Team
