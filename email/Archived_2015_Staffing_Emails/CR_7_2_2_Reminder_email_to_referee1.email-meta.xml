Your feedback will help us to judge their suitability to work with young people on our residential youth and community programme. Without acceptable feedback from two referees, the candidate will be deemed unsuitable for the programme and will not be allowed to carry out their placement.


Please complete the following questions and email them back to staffing.support@the-challenge.org.
