A BIG THANK YOU FROM THE STAFFING TEAM

It&apos;s been one hell of a summer, but we did it! All ten of our summer ‘waves’ are now finished, and we’re looking forward to seeing how all the teams get on in the real world with their social action projects. All that’s left for us to do now is say a massive thankyou to everyone who supported the NCS programme over the last few weeks!

This summer we worked with an incredible 27,070 young people, with [number] teams uniting to make a change in their local communities. None of this would have been possible without your help.

We’d still love to hear about your experiences this summer - remember to share your stories with @seasonalstaff on Twitter, or on our Seasonal Staff Facebook page!



NCS AUTUMN 2015 - WHO&apos;S READY?

The NCS Autumn programe
We’re just weeks away from the beginning of the NCS Autumn programme; a shortened programme which takes place in the October half term. We can’t wait for the Autumn waves to start - we hope you’re excited too!

What do I need to do?
If you’re set to work with us during October, now’s the time to make sure that we have all of your correct personal information. Please head to the Staffing Website to ensure that your health &amp; safety information, emergency contact details, and bank &amp; tax information is all up-to-date.

Haven&apos;t heard from us?
If you’ve signed up for the NCS Autumn programme, but haven’t had any job placements confirmed yet, please do get in touch with your local staffing team to make sure that they know your full availability. Please note: as the Autumn programme is much shorter than our Summer one, we will prioritise candidates who are available for the entirety of their chosen Autumn wave.

See you in October!

CHECK OUT THE &apos;LONDONERS STORIES&apos; PAGE ON FACEBOOK

‘Londoners Stories’ is a public page on Facebook dedicated to publishing the heart-warming ‘good news’ stories of random strangers all across London.
It’s creator Francis, one of our fantastic photography practitioners, updates the page weekly and has recently started uploading stories from other seasonal staff members to highlight just how much the NCS programme affects both young people and their supporting staff. Here are a couple of the stories from the programme:

“With NCS The Challenge, the biggest lesson I learnt is the difference a change in environment can make… Young people doubt themselves far too much and do not give themselves enough credit… because they have become so accustomed to a certain environment. I found how priviged and happy the young people were to learn new things from a different group of people.”

“I will always remember the day when [my team] came in on the first day… They were scared and nervous. The transformation that they made individually and with each other to become one unit, working together towards a common goal is amazing.”

Go ahead and have a look at the page - and maybe even send in your own ‘good news’ story! Here’s what Francis has to say about his project:

“Simply, being a photographer and someone who loved ‘humans’ - as weird as that sounds - made me want to create some kind of platform where I can share people’s stories. From long, heart-warming stories, to light, easy stories, I just wanted to do something that allowed me to do something in that vein. It is the scariest thing going up to random people, asking them random questions and a photo to be taken of them. Nonetheless, it’s worked out really well. The hardest aspect of the page is that I don’t do it full time, it’s one of many projects, as well as working - so I really have to make time for it. On the other hand, it encourages me to take my camera everywhere, which is great for every photographer!”
