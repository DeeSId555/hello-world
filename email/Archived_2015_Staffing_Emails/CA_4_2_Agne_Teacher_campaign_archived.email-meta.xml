CALLING ALL TEACHERS

Spread the word about NCS!

Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

We hope that you enjoyed working with The Challenge last year to deliver NCS.

Here are The Challenge we do everything we can to ensure that every single young person in the areas we work in gets the chance to sign up to our NCS programme.

We would like to ask you, as a teacher, and as an advocate of NCS (we hope!), to help us spread the word even further. If you work at a secondary school or college and we haven&apos;t come in to talk to your students about the programme, we would love for you to get in touch with the contacts below.

We look forward to hearing from you!

The Challenge Team
