Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Applications for the NCS Autumn programme are now open! As we didn’t get the chance to meet you prior to the Summer programme, we’d love to be able to fast-track your application for the autumn.

Tell me more about the Autumn programme

Our Autumn programme is a miniature version of the summer, comprising of the same components but lasting for only a week (with some weekends in November) during October half-term. We have availability in the Programme Leader, Assistant Programme Leader, Senior Mentor, Support Worker and Practitioner (all skills) roles.

To see the possible work dates for your preferred role, please refer to the job description (wave dates can be found on the last page).

Our Staffing Team will be looking over applications for our seasonal roles over the coming weeks, and successful applicants will be invited to one of our group assessments!

If you will not be available for the Autumn programme, or are no longer interested in working with us, please let us know via our general email: seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.


We’ll be in touch soon!


Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
