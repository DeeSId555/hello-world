Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Welcome back to NCS! We hope you are looking forward to working on the February (Spring) programme.

What do you need to do before you start your role?

We need you to do a few things before you can start your role.

Role Guides, Contracts and Timetables - deadline 9th February

Your contract is now available on the Staffing Website. Please read the full contract and submit a response. You will be unable to work on the NCS programme without submitting this.

Role guides for February 2015 can be found under ‘My Role’. Please view this document before starting the programme.

Your timetable is available under ‘My Role’. Please note that timetables for some elements of the programme will be available at a later date - more information can be found on the Staffing Website.


Health, Safety and Inclusion Information, and Emergency Contact Details - deadline 9th February

All seasonal staff must submit up-to-date Health, Safety and Inclusion information and Emergency Contact details. We need this to ensure that we have appropriate information to adequately support all our staff and accommodate specific additional needs.

You must submit this information before the deadline to ensure that we have sufficient time to convey this information to our providers and carry out any additional actions.



Bank and Tax Information - deadline 19th February

Please ensure that you submit up-to-date information for your bank and tax details. This is essential in ensuring that you are paid on time and taxed the correct amount for your role.

If you do not submit this information you risk a delay in being paid and could be incorrectly taxed.

For further information about tax please contact HMRC.



Thank you in advance for completing these tasks at short notice and we hope you are ready and eager to start the programme!

If you have any further questions please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.

Best wishes,
