Dear {!Job_placement__c.Contact_Name__c},

We hope that you are excited to start your role on the NCS programme!

It is possible that you will incur expenses during your work with us. This email gives you the opportunity to submit any expenses which fall within our policy.

What expenses can I submit?

We will only authorise expenses for essential travel during the programme. This does not cover your travel to or from your place of residence and NCS programme venues.

We occasionally cover other expenses in exceptional circumstances - these are dealt with on a case by case basis. You should speak to your Assistant Programme Manager before you submit a claim.


How do I submit an expense?

Click here to go the expense Expenses form.
 http://survey.clicktools.com/go?iv=1x0lrts1bnxq1

This expenses form is only valid for any work on {!Job_placement__c.Wave__c}.

Read all the instructions on the form - claims submitted incorrectly will not be processed.

Attach all the relevant receipts - please keep all receipts until your expense is reviewed. We can only accept scanned or clearly photographed receipts. Paper receipts handed in or posted will not be processed.

Reuse this form as many times as you need to fit all your expenses per wave.


THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING EXPENSES IS MARCH 31ST

EXPENSES SUBMITTED AFTER THIS DATE WILL NOT BE PROCESSED


When will I get reimbursed?

Each expenses claim is subject to authorisation by your local programmes team. As soon as expenses are authorised they will be in one of three expense runs listed below.


Run 1: w/c 2 March

Run 2: w/c 23 March

Run 3 : w/c 13 April

We encourage you to submit your expenses regularly - on a weekly basis where possible.

If you have any questions please contact your local staffing representative quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.


Best wishes,

The Challenge
