Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As the NCS February programme draws to a close, we thought we’d remind everyone who has worked over the last month to submit their expense claims before the deadline of 31st March 2015.


New expense run scheduled!

We’re sorry to say that there was an issue with the expense form we initially sent out in our previous email, and any expense claims submitted before the 9th March have not been recorded. Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience or confusion caused by this error, and re-submit your expense claims using the link below.

To make it up to you, we’ve scheduled an additional expense run for Monday 16th March - please (re)submit your expense claims before this date and we will make sure we get your approved expenses returned to you!



How to submit expense claims

Click here to access the Expense Form. 
http://survey.clicktools.com/app/survey/response.jsp

Make sure that you attach clear photographed or scanned copies of all relevant receipts, and keep the original copies until your expenses are reviewed. Please note that paper receipts handed in or posted will not be processed.

Each expense claim is subject to approval by your programmes team. If you don’t manage to submit your expense claims by the 16th March, your approved expenses will be reimbursed to you on one of the following dates:

Run 2: w/c 23rd March

Run 3: w/c 13th April

Please remember that the deadline to submit all expenses for the February programme is 31st March 2015. If you have any questions please contact your local staffing representative, quoting the email reference number below.


We hope that you’ve had a great time on the February programme, and look forward to working with you again in the future.

Best wishes,

The Challenge
NCS Programme
