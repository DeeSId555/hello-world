Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your work so far on the NCS summer programme. As you know, NCS: Real Challenge Action (RCA) weekends are coming up in September. As part of your role you are contracted to work a minimum of 4 days in this period.

The RCA part of the programme takes place on Saturdays or Sundays during each weekend in September. You will be required to work one day each week* based on your young person&apos;s allocated days. These work dates generally last from 9:00am until 17:30pm.

The RCA September weekend dates are:

Saturday 5 September
Sunday 6 September
Saturday 12 September
Sunday 13 September
Saturday 19 September
Sunday 20 September
Saturday 26 September
Sunday 27 September


Please fill out this short survey to indicate your availability:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NBB36DJ


The young person you supported will either carry out their RCA weekends every Saturday or Sunday. Ideally, you would continue to support the same young person as they finish the NCS programme, so the more dates you are available for the better!

If you cannot work on your allocated days we can potentially offer you other weekend dates in September, however this is not something we are able to guarantee. If this is the case, any required RCA dates that you cannot attend will be deducted from your pay at the standard daily rate (Â£85).

*Please note: If you worked two or more waves this summer, you are contracted to work on all 8 weekend dates listed above. For more information or if you have any concerns around this, please contact Alice on 0203 691 8723.


Once again we&apos;d like to thank you for all your hard work over the course of the summer programme. We look forward to seeing you again in September!


Best wishes,

Alice McFarlane
