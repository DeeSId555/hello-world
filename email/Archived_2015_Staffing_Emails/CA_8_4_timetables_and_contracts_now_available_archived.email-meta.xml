Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Summer is almost here and we know that you have all been speaking to your staffing contact to arrange work dates and locations.

With this in mind, this is a quick email to let you know that the &apos;My Role&apos; section of the website is now open!

In this section you are able to review both your timetable and contract, so please log on to the Staffing Website and review.

Practitioners and Residential Mentors - please note:

Although your timetable will be available for reference, unfortunately you will not be able to review your contract until the week commencing the 25th of May. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

If you have any questions regarding the information displayed on this page then please do  contact your local staffing team quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.

Best wishes,
The Challenge
