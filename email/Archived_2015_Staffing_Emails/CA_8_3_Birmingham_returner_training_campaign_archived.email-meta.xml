Dear {Contact.FirstName},

We look forward to seeing you at your returner training tomorrow!

In advance of this, we just wanted to confirm and clarify what you will need to bring with you on the day.

Please bring the following documents with you to training to help us confirm your identity, Right To Work (RTW) in the UK, and your suitability to work with children and young people. These documents will need to be witnessed and scanned by a member of the Staffing Team.

See below a detailed breakdown of which documents are required -

1. RTW Evidence

You will need to provide evidence (original documents) that you have the RTW in the UK - failure to do so could affect your placement with us. The most common proof of RTW in the UK is a valid and in date British Passport. If you do not have this, please check what documents you can bring via the Gov.uk website.

N.B all staff who brought RTW documents to assessment will need to be checked again.


2. DBS Certificates (if applicable)

All staff who provided a scanned copy of a valid enhanced DBS certificate (with Check of Children&apos;s Barred List) must bring this to training. If you cannot find your DBS certificate you should contact your local staffing team immediately.

All staff who were asked to apply for a new DBS certificate through our partner organisation GB Group will not need to bring in their DBS certificate unless they have been asked to.


3. Identification

All staff should bring valid photo ID.


If you have any questions regarding this then do not hesitate to get in touch with your Staffing Associate, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.

Many thanks for your continued support,

The Staffing Team
