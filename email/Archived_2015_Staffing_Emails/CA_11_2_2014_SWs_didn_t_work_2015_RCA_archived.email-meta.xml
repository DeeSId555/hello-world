Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope you&apos;ve had a great year since we&apos;ve last seen you! The 2015 NCS programme has been as hectic, exciting and rewarding as always, and we&apos;re hoping that you&apos;d be interested in helping us finish off the Summer programme...


Ad-hoc Support Worker roles in September

The NCS: Real Challenge Action weekends are well under-way, and we&apos;ve seen teams of young people carry out some incredible social action projects within their communities. We&apos;ve already heard some wonderful stories of young people coming out of their shells and transforming as a result of the Summer programme. However, there still remain some young people who need a Support Worker for RCA.

As previous Support Worker staff, you will know just how important this additional support it. We desperately want all young people who attended the NCS programme over the summer to be able to complete this final section with their teams and go on to become NCS Graduates.


How can I help?

We&apos;re looking for alumni Support Workers to take on ad-hoc roles of the remaining September weekends. Work dates available are:

Saturday 19 September
Sunday 20 September
Saturday 26 September
Sunday 27 September

If you have any availability for the dates above please fill out this short survey and let us know! We&apos;ll use your 2014 job application to match you to a young person whose needs match your skills:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JV7HSL7

You will be paid a daily rate of Â£85 for each/any RCA dates you work.


Any questions?

If you have any questions about the NCS: RCA dates, or would like to discuss your availability, please do get in touch! You can contact the Support Worker team on 0203 691 8723 or alice.mcfarlane@the-challenge.org.


Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
