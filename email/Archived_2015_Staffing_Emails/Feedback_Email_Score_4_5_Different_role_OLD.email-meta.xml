Dear {!Contact.Name}



Many thanks for your contribution on the 2014 NCS Programme. We hope you have enjoyed your experience with The Challenge and would like to work with us again in the future.



Performance feedback

Set out below is some feedback on your performance this year and an outline of options available to you in 2015.



How was my performance during the programme?



Feedback for your overall performance was: {!Job_Application__c.Overall_Score__c}



I would like to work for NCS with the Challenge again what are my options?



1. Recommended option Apply for the role of {!Job_Application__c.Recommendation_for_next_year__c}.

Based on your feedback, this would be our recommended role for you.

You will be required to attend an assessment for this role.



2. Apply for the same role of  {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}.

You would not need to re-assess for this role. However, all returning staff must complete a new application for the 2015 programmes (see the “what do I need to do next” section below).



3. Apply for a different role.

If you feel you have gained additional experience and relevant skills.

You would be required to attend an assessment if your application is successful.



NB. All roles are conditional on attendance at training, DBS and references and the availability of positions at the time of allocation. Not all roles are available in all areas and some roles have changed. Please check role descriptions for more details.
