Dear {!Contact.Name}


Following your phone call with your Programme Manager, it has been agreed that you will no longer be returning to work with us on our seasonal programmes.

Although this decision  may not be the outcome you had wished for, we hope that the feedback you received was helpful to you.

Thank you for your contribution to our previous seasonal programmes, and we wish you success in your future ventures.


Best Wishes
