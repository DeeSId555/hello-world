Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Many thanks for attending an assessment for the NCS programme. We assess candidates against a range of criteria but unfortunately, on this occasion you did not meet the requirements for a role on the programme.

We appreciate that this must be disappointing news for you. However, we would love you to stay involved with our work. Some of the options are outlined below:


I still want to be involved, what else can I do?

If you would still like to be involved in our seasonal programmes the Associate Mentor and Senior Associate Mentor roles may be perfect for you.

Associate Mentor: this role is for those who have graduated from NCS with The Challenge within the past two years.

Senior Associate Mentor: this role is for those who have completed a role as an Associate Mentor within the past year.

These voluntary roles can help you gain valuable experience and skills required for youth and community work, and may lead on to a paid role with us in the future.


Sounds great, how do I apply?

If you are interested in either the Associate Mentor or Senior Associate Mentor roles, you will need to register your interest by emailing graduates@the-challenge.org.


Thank you for your interest in the NCS programme and we hope to work with you in the future.

Best Wishes

The Challenge
NCS Programme
