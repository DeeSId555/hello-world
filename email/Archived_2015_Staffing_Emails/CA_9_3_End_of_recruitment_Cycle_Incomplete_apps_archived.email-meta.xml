Dear {!Contact.Name},

We have noticed that you haven’t completed your application for a seasonal role on this summer’s NCS Programme. We have now finished recruiting for all of our seasonal roles for Summer 2015, and regret that we will not be able to work with you on the upcoming programme.


How else can I get involved?

Work on our Autumn and Spring 2015 programmes

Applications for our other 2015 seasonal programmes will open soon. These programmes take place during the October and February half-terms and are shorter versions of our Summer programme, lasting just a week with some weekend dates in November or March. We’ll be in touch when our applications open again - you won&apos;t be required to fill out another application form. If you think you’d like to work in the Autumn or the Spring, please do look out for our email!


Thank you for your interest in The Challenge and the NCS Programme; we look forward to hearing from you in the future.


Best wishes,

The Challenge
