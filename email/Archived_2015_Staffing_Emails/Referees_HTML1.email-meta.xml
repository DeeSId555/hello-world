The Challenge - Seasonal Staff Reference Form

Dear Sir or Madam

The Challenge is the largest provider of NCS, an intense youth and community programme. We recruit seasonal staff to work on the NCS programme in various roles working with 15-17 year olds both residentially and non-residentially. For this reason we ask all potential staff to provide contact details for referees who can indicate their suitability to work on the programme.

One of our candidates, [contact name], has named you as one of their referees.

Please reply to this email, giving a character reference for the candidate and indicating their suitability to work with young people. Please consider the following in your response:

A - Would this candidate provide a strong role model?

B - Is the candidate organised and enthusiastic?

C - Is the candidate energetic and positive?

D - Would you be happy with this person to work with young people?

If you have any questions in regard to this reference request, please contact staffing.support@the-challenge.org.

Thank you for your time and co-operation!

Best wishes,

The Challenge
