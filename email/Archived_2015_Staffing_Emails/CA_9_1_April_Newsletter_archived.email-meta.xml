NCS TEAMS REUNITE FOR SOCIAL ACTION DAY!

In March, around 100 social action projects took place across the country aiming to tackle local issues and promote NCS. In the North West, teams came together for a community clean up in Manchester. In Reading, NCS Graduates wrapped gifts for local children’s organisations with the help of MP Rob Wilson (Reading East).

In West London several projects saw our young people sleeping outside to raise awareness of youth homelessness, collecting ‘sign-ups’ in Victoria station, and teams pitching for funding for their projects in front of the ‘Dragons’. The evening rounded off for West London Graduates with a silent disco with over 100 young people attending!


Thank you to all the staff who dedicated their free time to the Social Action Day - we hope the day was as rewarding for you as it was for the young people!



TRAINING DATES WITH THE CHALLENGE

Training is live on the Staffing Website!
Our training sessions for all the seasonal roles are coming up soon - thanks to everyone who has already booked onto their training event. For those who haven&apos;t yet done so, please head to the Staffing Website now to secure your place at training!

What&apos;s new?
This year&apos;s training has been revolutionised, covering new curriculums, management, facilitation strategies, and mentoring skills to make sure you&apos;re more ready than ever to start your role.

Returner Training
Last year, lots of you suggested that the training days were too long and repetitive for returning seasonal staff, so we&apos;ve created a brand-new &apos;Returner Training Session&apos; in which you can select which workshops and skills you want to brush-up on for your summer role.

We&apos;re really looking forward to seeing you all again at training, and are even more excited to start the summer programme - we hope you are too!

TELL YOUR FRIENDS - APPLICATIONS ARE STILL OPEN!

Would your friends or colleagues love the NCS programme?
We still have some limited availability for experienced and motivated people to work as Programme Leaders, Assistant Programme Leaders and Media Practitioners.

Our applications will be closing soon! Please help us to give as many young people and seasonal staff as possible the summer of a lifetime. Spread the word and tell your friends to head to www.ncsthechallenge.org/seasonal-roles.

SOCIAL INTEGRATION COMMISSION

Although you may have been working with The Challenge on the NCS seasonal programmes for years, you might not know about what else we have going on. Alongside the NCS programe delivery and our Head Start and Step Forward projects for 17-19 year-olds, The Challenge has also set up and sponsored the Social Integration Commission.

The Social Integration Commission is investigating how far the UK is socially divided for culture, ethnicity, age and wealth, and the impact this has on our society. The Commission&apos;s three reports have now all been published, and are already sparking discussion in the media - if you&apos;d like to know more about the Social Integration Commision, head to it&apos;s website!

HOW HAS NCS CHANGED THE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE SO FAR?

Ever wondered how your work on the NCS programmes really affects young people after each summer? We carried out a mass survey of all young people who participated in the programme from 2011-2013 and asked them!

3,750 young people, aged 16-19, responded to our cries for feedback and told us more than we could have ever hoped for. 68% said that the programme helped them in the long-run in both education and employment, and 9 out of 10 participants said that they were more likely to engage in volunteering or community service after going on the programme!

Here are some of the comments we received:

&quot;It made me want to volunteer &amp; help out... I became more comfortable making new friends from different backgrounds.&quot;

&quot;I see and understand people from different backgrounds more&quot;

&quot;I&apos;ve grown more confident; it&apos;s changed my life.&quot;

The NCS programmes would not be the huge success that they are without the dedication and support of our seasonal staff. Thank you for being part of The Challenge!
