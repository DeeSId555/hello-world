Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations! Following your recent assessment with us, weâ€™d like to offer you a role this summer as a {!Job_Application__c.Role_to_assess_for__c}.

In the interest of fairness. we offer our roles on a first-come-first-serve basis. Unfortunately, we have currently allocated all of our roles for the upcoming seasonal programme. However, we would like to offer you a place on our back-up staff, and hope to be able to confirm a work placement for you soon.

What happens now?

Your programmes team will be in touch soon to discuss your role with you, and when a role becomes available, you will be contacted immediately.

In the meantime, if you have any questions about your role or the back-up staff process, please contact seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.

Thank you for your patience - we hope to be able to offer you a confirmed role soon!
