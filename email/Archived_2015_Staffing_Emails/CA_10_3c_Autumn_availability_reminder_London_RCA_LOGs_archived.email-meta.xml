Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope that you’ve had a great summer - we definitely have! The 2015 Summer programme is now coming to an end, but we still have some great opportunities for you to get involved in throughout September, October and November.

The NCS Autumn Programme - 25th August Deadline

A couple of weeks ago we asked you to update your availability for Autumn on the Staffing Website. We’ve had a huge response so far - if you’ve already told us your availability for Autumn, thank you! If you haven’t yet had a chance to update your availability, but know that you would like to work with us again during October and November, please do so by the 25th of August!

We use the availability of our summer staff to calculate how many new staff we will recruit for Autumn. As such, if you do want to work then letting us know before the above deadline will mean we are much more likely to have space for you in October!

The Autumn programme runs over the school October half-term, with some roles working two weekend dates in November. Please refer to this document to see which work dates are available for your role.


Click here to update your availability on the Staffing Website: https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fsecure%2f


Once we have collected your availability, your local staffing team will be in touch to discuss possible work placements!


NCS: Real Challenge Action - September weekends

For many of our seasonal roles, the NCS: RCA part of the summer programme is a fantastic way to get involved with the young people’s social action projects, and to see how the programme has truly enhanced the perspectives of our young people. Depending on your role and your wave, you will be contracted to work a minimum of 4 days over the September weekends.

If your role is involved in RCA weekends (check your job description to be sure!), your local staffing team will be in touch soon to allocate you to your weekend dates.

If you have any unavailability over the September weekends, please be sure to contact your local staffing team as soon as possible to let them know!



Logistics Officer roles in September

In addition to collecting availability for the RCA section of the summer programme for our current seasonal roles, we are also recruiting for an altogether different role for this period.

The Logistics Officer role (known as a Logs Officer internally) is very different to our other seasonal roles as it primarily works within our London offices. This role takes place over September, and focuses on helping the teams of young people to plan for their social action projects. The Logs Officer role is perfect for highly-organised individuals who want both experience in youth work and in office and project management roles.

If this sounds like a great role for you, or if you know anyone who would be a great candidate for this role, please get in touch with Jude Burrow (judith.burrow@the-challenge.org) for more information!


We hope to be working with you again soon!

Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
