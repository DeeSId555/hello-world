Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Sorry for the confusion! We’re aware that you’ve recently received an email from us inviting you to assessment…. again! Although we would love to see you once more, sadly we must admit that the email was sent in error.

Please disregard the email and rest assured that your provisional job offer remains in place and we won’t be asking for anymore icebreakers anytime soon!

Please continue to follow the processes as per your offer email and we look forward seeing you on the programme this year.

As always, if you have any questions, please contact your local staffing team, citing the email reference number below, or see our FAQs.


Best wishes,

The Challenge
