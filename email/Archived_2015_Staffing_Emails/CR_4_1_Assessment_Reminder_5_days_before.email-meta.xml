Dear {!Contact.Name},



This is a reminder that you are booked to attend a group assessment on {!Staffing_Event_Day__c.Day_date__c}.



What should I do?

Please log into the Staffing Website and go to &apos;Booking Assessments&apos;. Here, you will be able to review:
https://staffing.the-challenge.org


Date, time and location of your booked assessment .

What you will need to prepare

The type of ID documents you will need to bring




If you have any problems on the day please contact your local staffing team.

Please ensure that you check for any changes to your assessment details the night before. These will be updated on the &apos;Assessment Booking Details&apos; page no later than a day before the event.



NCS with The Challenge is an equal opportunities employer. If you have not already done so, please notify us of any disability that you have that may require reasonable adjustment on our part during the assessment.



What if I can no longer attend?

Please contact us as soon as possible if you are not able to attend this assessment so that we can offer your place to another candidate. We will try to offer you an alternative assessment date, but unfortunately this is not always possible.
