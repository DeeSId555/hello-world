Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on being offered a provisional role with us this summer as a Support Worker or Personal Coach! We are delighted to have you on board, and can’t wait for this the NCS summer programme to begin.

What happens now?

Although the start dates for the summer programme are still a little way off, there are a few steps between the ‘offer stage’ and the beginning of your role.

‘Matching’: You will be carefully matched to a young person with additional needs based on your skills and experience. This process can take a while, as we also take your availability and preferred locations into account. Unfortunately, this means that in some cases you might not find out who you are supporting and when until a little closer to your start date, although we try to match Support Workers and Personal Coaches to young people as soon as possible.

The matching process is made a lot easier if we have all the correct information on your availability, so please ensure that you update the ‘Choosing when I can work’ and ‘Dates when I can’t work’ sections if your availability over the summer changes at all!

Training: You will need to complete two days of training for the Support Worker role (plus an additional day for Personal Coaches).

One day is specific to the Support Worker role and the other is more general to give you a broader understanding of the programme and The Challenge ethos. Returning Support Workers and Personal Coaches will be able to book onto ‘Returner Training’ to refresh their skills. Please book onto training via the Staffing Website.

Please note: in some cases, we might not have found you a match before you attend your training. If for any reason we are unable to find you a match with a young person, we will endeavour to find you a suitable alternative role if possible.

DBS process and other Essential Information: If you already have an ‘Enhanced DBS certificate’ with the ‘Children’s Barred List’ check, please upload it to the Essential Information section on the Staffing Website. If you don’t currently have a valid DBS, please head to the Staffing Website to start a new application with our partner organisation GB Group. The DBS process can take up to 4 weeks to complete, so please start your application as soon as possible! For more information on the DBS process, please see our FAQs.

Please also make sure that the rest of the ‘Essential Information’ section is filled out fully before starting your role - we are currently in the process of contacting referees, so please make sure you keep any eye on your ‘References Status’.

What else?

A few technical glitches - sorry!

You may have noticed that over the last few weeks we have been experiencing some technical errors on our Staffing Website - we’d like to apologise for any inconvenience or confusion caused! The ‘Upload existing DBS’ button is now working again on the ‘Disclosure and Barring Service’ section (under Essential Information), and the References section is now working without any errors.

Thank you for your patience at the moment. We appreciate it can be frustrating having to wait to know when you will be working, however we need to ensure we can provide the best support possible for our young people.

In the meantime, if you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact me on 0203 691 8723 or alice.mcfarlane@the-challenge.org.


Best wishes,

Alice McFarlane
