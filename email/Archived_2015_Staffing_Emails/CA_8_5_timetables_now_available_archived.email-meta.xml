Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Summer is almost here and we know that you have all been speaking to your staffing contact to arrange work dates and locations.

With this in mind, this is a quick email to let you know that the &apos;My Role&apos; section of the website is now open!

In this section you are able to view your timetable, so please do log onto the staffing website to review.

Although currently unavailable, shortly you will also be able to review your contracts on the same page.

If you have any questions regarding the information displayed on your timetable then please do  contact your local staffing team quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.

Best wishes,
The Challenge
NCS Programme
