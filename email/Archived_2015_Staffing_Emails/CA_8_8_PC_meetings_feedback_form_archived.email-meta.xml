Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on being offered a role as a Personal Coach! The link below will download a ‘Personal Coach review form’, to be used following meetings with your young person before, during and after the programme.

Please click here to download the review form: 

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/assets/Personal_Coach_Review_Form.docx


Personal Coach Review Form - what is it for?

We use the information supplied in the review form to assess how far the NCS programme has helped your young person engage and grow in confidence. In the form, we ask you to comment on their achievements, behaviour, relationships and enthusiasm for NCS.


When do I need to fill in the form?

We ask that you fill in the form after the following occasions:

- After each additional meeting with your young person (you are required to attend around six meeting which will be arranged before and after the programme).

- At the end of each section/week of the programme.

- After each Real Challenge Action day in September

In the case of ‘additional meetings’ you will need to give information on where and when each meeting took place.


How do I submit the review form?

Once you have completed the review form please return it to your Programme Manager via email. Your Programme Manager will introduce themselves and give you their contact details once you have been matched with a young person.

Once you have emailed the review form to your PM you must delete the file from your computer as per our Safeguarding policy.
