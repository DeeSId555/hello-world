Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


We noticed that you started your application to work on the NCS programme some time ago. The recruitment for summer is well under-way and our roles are filling up fast!



With this in mind, we wanted to give you the opportunity to submit your completed application before our 1st May deadline.


Why should you submit your application now?



By submitting your application now you will benefit from..




a greater choice of assessment dates
a greater chance of securing your preferred role, location and work dates.




Click here to continue your application



What happens if I miss the deadline?



As you started your application some time ago, if it is still incomplete after the 1st May, we will place it on hold. This means that we will assume, unless we hear from you, that you are no longer interested in working on the NCS programme this year.





Please contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org if you have any queries or if you are no longer interested in working with us. Please ensure you quote the email reference number below in any correspondence.


We look forward to receiving your completed application soon!


Best Wishes
