Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The Summer programme is drawing to a close, and it&apos;s time to start thinking ahead to the next season!

Recruitment for the 2015 NCS Autumn programme will begin soon. We&apos;d love to work with as many of our current and alumni staff as possible throughout this small-scale programme. If you are available during the October half-term and some weekends in November (not applicable for all roles), and are interested in working on the Autumn programme please let us know!


What do I need to do?

Please log in to the Staffing Website and head to the &apos;Choosing when I can work&apos; and &apos;Dates when I can&apos;t work&apos; sections. These have been updated with the Autumn waves for you to choose from.

You can see you role&apos;s start dates for each wave on your Role Description - please refer to this before confirming your availability for any waves!

Role descriptions: http://www.ncsthechallenge.org/seasonal-roles

Please note: As the Autumn programme is much shorter than the our Summer programme, we will prioritise staff who have full availability for their chosen wave(s).

We&apos;ll use this information when we start allocating staff to the Autumn waves. Your local staffing team will be in touch with more information about the Autumn programme once we have collected your availability.


Any questions?

If you have any questions about the Autumn programme, or your availability throughout this period, please contact your local staffing team, quoting the email reference number below in any correspondence.


We look forward to working with you again soon!

Best wishes,

The Challenge Staffing Team
NCS Programme
