Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


The NCS summer programme kicks off in just over one month. We&apos;re aware that we haven&apos;t got your Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion information yet, and we need this as soon as possible to ensure the programme is safe for you and others on the wave.


Health, Safeguarding &amp; Inclusion


Your offer is still conditional upon the the completion of the Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion section of your application under Essential Information. Please ensure you complete this form by Monday 16th May.


Anything you disclose will be treated confidentially. For more information on how we use this information, please see our ‘Health, Safeguarding &amp; Inclusion FAQs’.

If you would rather not disclose details of your additional needs on our application form, or if it is not the easiest way for you to communicate this information, you can contact our Inclusion Staffing Team (IST) either by email (inclusion.ss@the-challenge.org) or by phone (0203 542 2400).


DBS Applications


It is a legal requirement for all seasonal staff to have a valid DBS before they start their role. Please ensure you have started your DBS process by Monday 16th May, if you haven&apos;t already.



If you don&apos;t already have a DBS certificate, please start your application as soon as possible following these instructions. DBS applications can take up to 6 weeks to process.

If you already have a valid certificate dated from 1 January 2015, you’ll need to upload this to the ‘Essential Information’ page to support your application and have it verified it in-house when you start your training.


Any questions?


We’ll be in touch soon, but in the meantime, if you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact us using the email address below. You can also find general information about the NCS programme on our FAQs.


We look forward to working with you this summer!


Best wishes,



The Staffing Team
