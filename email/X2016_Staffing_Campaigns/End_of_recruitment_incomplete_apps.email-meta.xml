Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for starting a job application to work on the NCS summer programme in one of our seasonal roles. Applications for our roles have been open since December, and we’ve received an unprecedented amount of interest.



We appreciate you taking the time to start your application but due to the amount of interest we have received, we regret to advise that we are unable to consider any further applications for your preferred role(s).



The ‘My Application’ section on the Staffing Website will be closed shortly whilst we focus on the summer programme. This section will reopen in September when we resume recruitment for our NCS Autumn programme, and we urge you to continue your application from where you left it then.



NCS Autumn Programme 2016



Although we have finished recruiting for the summer programme, we will start reviewing applications again for our upcoming autumn programme. The NCS autumn programme will take place over October half term, continuing during November weekends. This shortened version of the NCS programme mimics the same structure of the summer programme, and we’ll be looking for confident leaders, passionate mentors and skilled practitioners (among other roles!) to help support the participating young people.



We’ll be in touch when applications for the NCS autumn programme open!



Any questions?



If you have any questions about the NCS autumn programme please contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.



We’d like to apologise for any inconvenience or disappointment and thank you for your interest in The Challenge and the NCS programme. We hope to work with you in the autumn.



Best wishes,



The Challenge Staffing Team</textOnly>
