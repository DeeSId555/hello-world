Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The NCS summer programme kicks off this weekend, and we’re aware that you have not yet completed the application process - you still need to have your ID documents verified at the post office.

It is a legal requirement for all seasonal staff working on the NCS programme to have a valid DBS certificate. If you do not have one we will withdraw you from any waves you are allocated to, and you will not be entitled to compensation.

What do I need to do?

If you started your online application less than 14 days ago, you still have time to take your documents to the Post Office for verification. After this period, your DBS application will be automatically withdrawn and you’ll need to re-register with the same email address and start the process again.

If you started the online application more than 14 days ago your DBS application will already have been withdrawn due to inactivity. You need to re-register with the same email address and start the process again.

Regardless of when you started the online application, please make sure you take your ID and documents to the Post Office by 18th June 2016. We will be in touch in the week following if you have not fulfilled this requirement.

Any questions?

It’s urgent that you get your DBS sorted as soon as possible to avoid missing out on work this summer. If you have any queries about the DBS application, or your existing DBS certificate please get in touch with your local staffing team or contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.



Best wishes,



The Staffing Team
