Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Exciting news - the ‘availability’ sections are now open on the staffing website! Now’s the time to let us know your availability and select which ‘waves’ you would like to work on during the NCS summer programme.



What do I need to do?



There are two sections you need to complete in order to give us your full availability:



Choosing when I can work: in this section you’ll find a list of all the possible work dates for your particular role. These dates are broken down into ‘waves’.




Dates when I can’t work: here you’ll be able to indicate individual dates or short periods over the summer when you know you won’t be available. Please note, we will only offer you a role on a wave if you’re available to work for all of the dates.




Once you’ve completed these sections, we’ll use this information to try and match you to a vacant work placement. Please note that we cannot guarantee that you’ll be placed on your preferred wave.



What else?



Before we can confirm any work dates for you, you must have completed all the sections in the ‘Essential Information’ page. This includes:



Securing a valid ‘Enhanced DBS with Children’s Barred check’

Providing us with two satisfactory references

Completing your ‘health, safeguarding and inclusion’ form

Providing contact details for your emergency contact




You’ll also need to attend up to 3 days of compulsory training for your role - the ‘booking training’ page on the staffing website will be open from April with a range of training dates for you to choose from.



Any questions?



If you have any questions about the availability sections or would like to discuss your availability, please contact your local staffing team directly. You can also find information on our FAQs.



Best wishes,



The Staffing Team
