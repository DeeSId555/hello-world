Spread the word and refer a friend before it&apos;s too late!

If you were one of the many people who submitted an application over Easter, thank you for being patient while our staffing application website dealt with the high volume of applications.

In this issue:

• Staffing spotlight on: Lancashire
• Brand new:  Mental Health Adviser role!
• This month: book onto your NCS training!
• 5 minutes with... Olivia Zeltner (seasonal staff)
• Opportunities with our partners

STAFFING SPOTLIGHT ON: LANCASHIRE

In Lancashire, there are still waves available in Blackpool, Preston, Blackburn, Burnley and Skelmersdale! We&apos;re also still looking for experienced and hard-working candidates to take on the Delivery Assistant Programme Manager role in our Preston office.

This is a 4 month role working as part of our core team setting up the NCS Programme and managing logistics and directing staff on the ground. This is a great opportunity for confident communicators wanting to gain experience in events and project management. Do you know someone who fits the bill?  Send them to our website to apply!

BRAND NEW - MENTAL HEALTH ADVISER ROLE

The Inclusion Staffing Team is now recruiting for a full time role in London and all of our regional offices.

The Mental Health Adviser role is a core role which will provide support for young people with mental health conditions whilst they&apos;re on the programme, by offering advice to the young person&apos;s team of support staff.

Find out more about the MHA role here, and send your CV and cover letter to mha@the-challenge.org.

THIS MONTH: BOOK ONTO YOUR NCS TRAINING!

This month we&apos;ll be releasing our training dates for the summer, so look out for details on how you can book onto your relevant training sessions.

Previously, you&apos;ve given us feedback on how we could do it better - you&apos;ve asked us for shorter sessions and more updates on the programme and how it&apos;s changed, and we&apos;ve listened!

New for this year, if you&apos;re returning for the second year in a row, you&apos;ll only be required to attend one full day of jam-packed training.

If this is your 3rd year (in a row), you will only need to attend one 3-hour evening session to catch up on changes to the NCS programme!



5 MINUTES WITH... OLIVIA ZELTNER (SEASONAL STAFF)

Name: Olivia Zeltner

Occupation: I now work in The Challenge Staffing Team as a member of core staff.

My last role on NCS was... I worked on the programme as a Support Worker in summer 2015.

This year on NCS I will... be very excited to work on the programme again!


Most rewarding part of NCS: At first, my young person&apos;s team didn&apos;t quite know how to act around or befriend someone with severe learning difficulties. By the end of the programme, his team had grown to understand the best ways to engage with him - everyone went out of their way to talk to him!

Most challenging part: Supporting my young person 24/7. We learned that the best way to do this was for myself and his other support worker to take shifts - she would be on call during the evening, and I would get up early with him and vice-versa.

When I&apos;m not working on NCS, you will find me... Either in The Challenge office, or clocking up my marathon training around London.

Thanks Olivia! If, like us, you got all warm and fuzzy reading about Olivia&apos;s NCS experience, and you haven&apos;t signed up for this year&apos;s programme yet,  reapply now before it&apos;s too late!

OPPORTUNITIES WITH OUR PARTNERS

Year Here is a platform for graduates and young professionals who want to build smart responses to social problems.

Over 10 months, our Fellows learn from, and design with, people at the frontline of inequality - in care homes, hostels and youth services across London. Year Here is about learning in the real world rather than in a lecture hall. Through 3 major projects in very different contexts, you&apos;ll have multiple opportunities to build a smart, scalable response to some of society&apos;s toughest challenges. There are no tuition fees, and we can offer some bursaries and cheap accommodation.

Applications to become a Fellow close 11th April - apply now at YearHere.org
