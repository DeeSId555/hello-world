Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You can now book onto training for your role on the staffing website!

Staff returning to the NCS programme for the second year in a row only need to attend one full day of returner training.

This jam-packed full day of training will cover updates to the NCS programme, a recap on The Challenge’s safeguarding policies and best practice, and break-out workshops in the following subjects:

Managing challenging behaviour
Inclusive facilitation
Working relationships
Leadership and Youth led

This training is a compulsory part of all our seasonal roles, and we can’t let you work on the programme without completing it.

What do I need to do?

Head to the staffing website now and go to the ‘Booking Training’ page to see a list of possible training dates.

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx

You must respond to all dates offered to you - select either ‘register’ or ‘decline’ for each date.

If you can’t make any of the dates offered to you, or if no dates are available, contact your local staffing team as soon as possible.

Our training sessions (especially those taking place over weekends) tend to book up very quickly. Make sure you choose your dates and ‘submit’ them as soon as possible to avoid losing your place!

Any questions?

If you’d like to find out more about our training sessions and what they’ll cover, you can find information on our FAQs. If you’re having trouble booking onto any of your training sessions you can call your local staffing local team.

We look forward to seeing you again at training!

Best wishes,
