Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for applying to work on our NCS summer programme this year. We’ve received over 14,000 applications for our roles, and we’re looking forward to the programme kicking-off in two weeks.



We screen our candidates on a first come, first served basis. Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming number of applications we have received this year, we regret that we will be unable to consider your application for a role with us this summer.



The NCS Autumn Programme



As we are not able to review your application for the summer programme, your application will be put ‘on hold’ and will remain in our system for when we begin recruitment for our Autumn programme.



The NCS Autumn programme is a condensed version of our summer programme and takes place over one week during the October half term, and continues over the following November weekends. This year we will be looking for roughly 1,200 seasonal staff to support the Autumn programme nationally.



Recruitment for the Autumn programme will begin in August/September; we’ll be in touch with more information later in the summer.



Any questions?



We’ll contact you directly if we’re able to offer you any of our remaining summer roles, so there’s no need to get in touch to find out if you’re successful. If you have any questions about the autumn programme, please do contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org however please note that we will not be able to respond to any queries over the bank holiday weekend.



We’d like to apologise for any inconvenience or disappointment, and hope that we can work with you in the future.



Best wishes,


The Challenge Staffing Team</textOnly>
