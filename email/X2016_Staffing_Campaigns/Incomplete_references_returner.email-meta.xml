Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

In the final few days before the NCS Summer programme finally kicks off, it&apos;s imperative that all of our seasonal staff have completed all of their &apos;compliance&apos; measures. This includes obtaining a valid DBS certificate, completing their Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion form, and submitting contact details for satisfactory referees.

Our records show that we haven&apos;t obtained a satisfactory reference for you yet. As you&apos;ve worked with us before, we are already providing one of your references (your &apos;Referee 1&apos;). However, we still need to hear back from your Referee 2 before we can let you work on the programme.

What do I need to do?

Head to the Essential Information page on the staffing website and check your References &apos;status&apos;. This will indicate whether your referee is blank, unsuitable or unresponsive.

If your referee is blank, please update your application with contact details for a suitable referee within 5 days.

If your referee is unsuitable, you will need to update your application with contact details for an alternative referee within five days. Please note that a suitable referee knows you from a (1) educational, (2) employment, or (3) voluntary capacity. We cannot accept personal referees (such as friends or family members), or two referees from the same institution.

If your referee is unresponsive, we will have unsuccessfully tried to contact them on no less than 3 occasions. Please contact your referee and check that they are willing to provide a reference for you. If they are, ask them to get in touch with our HR partners Evolution Recruitment on staffing.support@the-challenge.org, or phone them on 0208 673 2211. If they&apos;re not happy to provide a reference for you, you&apos;ll need to give us contact details for another referee.

If your DBS status indicates that we&apos;re in the process of contacting your referees, you don&apos;t need to update anything on the staffing portal. However, please get in touch with your referees and make sure they&apos;re aware that we&apos;ll be contacting them in the next week or so.


Any questions?



If you have any questions about our references policy, or are having trouble securing two references, please contact your Staffing Associate directly.



Best wishes,



The Challenge Staffing Team</textOnly>
