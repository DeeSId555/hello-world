Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on being provisionally offered one of our inclusion roles for Summer 2016!

&apos;Matching&apos; you to a young person

As our Inclusion roles generally work on a 1-2-1 basis with a young person, in order to be allocated to a work placement in the summer, we&apos;ll need to match you to a young person. We match young people to support staff based on the young person&apos;s needs and your background, experience and abilities.

In order to do this, we&apos;ll need to send you anonymous, sensitive information about your young person. As you are not contractually employed by The Challenge yet, we ask that you sign a confidentiality agreement ahead of us sending this information to you.

What do I need to do?

Please download the Confidentiality Agreement and print, read and return a signed copy to us no later than 3 June 2016.

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/assets/INCLUSION_DISCLOSURE_AGREEMENT_2016_(2).docx

Return your signed and scanned copy to inclusionroles@the-challenge.org. Your signed agreement will then be added to your profile, and we&apos;ll be able to start the matching process!

Any questions?

If you&apos;d like any further information or clarification, please don&apos;t hesitate to get in touch using the contact details below - we&apos;ll be in touch in the coming weeks when the matching process is underway.

Best wishes,
