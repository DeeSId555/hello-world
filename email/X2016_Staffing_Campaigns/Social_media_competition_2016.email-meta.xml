All safeguarding policies apply, so under no circumstances are there to be any photos or names of young people in the programme included in entries. The young people on the programme cannot be mentioned in any posts and cannot feature in any of the photographs including the background of any of the photographs.

If you’re unsure, refer to the guidance in your role manual or speak to your Manager.
