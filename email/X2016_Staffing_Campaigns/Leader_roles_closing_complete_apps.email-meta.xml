Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for applying to be a Leader on the NCS summer programme. We&apos;re now halfway through the summer programme, and have offered more than 5,000 seasonal roles since applications opened in December.

We have now fully recruited all of our roles for this summer, including the Programme Leader and Assistant Programme Leader roles which remained open for a little longer than the others. We have received an unprecedented amount of interest in these roles, and unfortunately we don&apos;t have capacity to run any more assessments or training events for additional staff members. As a result, we are regrettably unable to consider your application for this season.

Although we cannot offer you any work for this summer, we&apos;d like to keep your application on our system ready for our autumn recruitment.

NCS Autumn programme

In October we&apos;ll be running our NCS autumn programme. This condensed programme features the same phases and roles as the summer programme but on a smaller scale, with each &apos;wave&apos; running over one week and continuing over some weekends in November.

If you would like to be considered to work in October, please ensure that you have selected &apos;Autumn&apos; as a season you can work in on your &apos;My Profile&apos; page. We&apos;ll be in touch with more information in September.


Thank you again for your interest in the NCS programme. We hope to be able to work with you soon!

Best wishes,

The Challenge Staffing Team</textOnly>
