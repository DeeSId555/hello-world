Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Congratulations - you’ve been allocated to work on the NCS Programme this summer.



We are pleased to tell you that the ‘My Role’ section on the staffing website (https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx) is now available. In this section you will find:


Your work timetable, including work dates and venue information
Your role guide and other resources which contain all the information you will need before embarking on your role with us this summer
Your contract, which you will need to sign before starting your role




What do I need to do?



Our timetables are updated in real-time, so make sure you go back and check the information again the day before your role starts!



Before we can let you work, we require you to ‘sign’ your contract. We would recommend that you download a copy for your own records.



What else?



You will receive payment information for each wave in a separate email within 24-48 hours of your contract being available on the staffing website. If you feel that you are missing anything please contact your staffing associate.



Any questions?



If you have any questions about your work placement, please contact your staffing associate directly. Their contact details can be found on our website https://staffing.the-challenge.org/contact/.



Best wishes,


The Challenge Staffing Team</textOnly>
