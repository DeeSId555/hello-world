Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope that you’ve had a great couple of months since the 2015 summer programme wrapped up! We have some exciting ad hoc opportunities coming up, and would love for you to resume your Support Worker and Personal Coach roles once again.

Ignite events in November

Throughout November, we will be hosting our annual Ignite events - a one-off day for the NCS graduates to celebrate what they have achieved through the NCS programmes this year, and to discover the next step for employment and community service.

In order for all NCS Graduates to be able to attend and fully participate throughout the day, we will need your help. This is an exciting opportunity for you to resume your role as a Support Worker or Personal Coach, and rejoin the young people you worked with on the programme.

Each Ignite event is organised by the local programmes team, and work dates and hours of work will vary by location.

If you are interested in resuming your role at an Ignite event, please let us know by emailing supportworkers@the-challenge.org or calling the Inclusion Staffing team on 0203 691 8723 to register your interest. Please note: spaces on these events will be limited, and roles will be allocated depending on each young person’s needs.

Year-round ad hoc opportunities

For 2016 we are looking for Support Workers and Personal Coaches who can fill in vacant roles on an ad hoc basis throughout the summer and autumn programmes. This opportunity is perfect for you if you don’t feel like you can commit to a whole ‘wave’ during the summer and/or autumn programmes, but would still like to be involved and make a difference on the NCS programmes.

This ad hoc work will primarily take place late June to early November 2016. If you are interested, please let us know by emailing supportworkers@the-challenge.org or calling the Inclusion Staffing team on 0203 691 8723 to register your interest and availability.

We hope to work with you again soon!


Best wishes,

The Inclusion Staffing Team</textOnly>
