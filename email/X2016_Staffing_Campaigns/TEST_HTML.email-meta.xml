THE IMPACT OF NCS: IPSOS MORI&apos;S FINDINGS

We’ve been singing praises for the impact that The Challenge’s NCS programmes have had in the last couple of issues, but how has the Government’s NCS initiative actually changed social integration in the UK? Third Sector magazine recently published a report analysing the impact of National Citizen Service in 2013 and 2014. Key findings included:

• NCS generated 8 million extra volunteering hours in 2013 and 2014.
• NCS graduates continued to volunteer in their free time, even up to a year after finishing the programme.
• In summer 2014, NCS delivered social benefits worth up to £252m, at the cost of £63.4m.
• In Nov 2015, the Government vowed to invest an additional £1.1bn to NCS.

TELL YOUR FRIENDS - LEADERS NEEDED!

You&apos;re probably sick about us shouting about this now, but one more time... Applications for summer 2016 are open now!

We especially need energetic, enthusiastic and encouraging people to join our seasonal workforce as Programme Leaders and Assistant Programme Leaders. If you think your friend or colleague has the confidence and skills to manage and lead a group of 60+ young people and 15+ staff through our intensive residential programme, direct them to our website!

TELL US MORE: NEW INCLUSION ROLES

For 2016 we&apos;ve vowed to make the NCS programme more accessible than ever to young people, regardless of their backgrounds or needs. Our dedicated Inclusion Staffing Team are rolling out the new  Learning &amp; Behaviour Mentor role, and investing in the existing  Support Worker and  Personal Coach roles more. This means:

• NCS will be accessible to even more young people
• More specialist roles to suit candidates&apos; skills &amp; experience
• We&apos;ll be able to provide professional development to our seasonal staff focusing on behaviour management.
