Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on your job offer. Our NCS summer programme starts in less than two months. Before we let you work on the programme we need to ensure you have avalid DBS certificate. This is a legal requirement and we can’t let you work on the programme without it.

Please follow the steps below to start your DBS process this week.

Applying for a new DBS

Follow these instructions to apply for a new DBS through our partner GB Group:

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/assets/2016DBSinstructionspostoffer.pdf

You’ll need up to four forms of ID to hand

DBS applications can take up to six weeks to process - please start your application as soon as possible and ensure you get your documents verified at the post office by 15th May to avoid delays.

Already have a valid certificate?

If you already have a DBS certificate, please first check it’s valid. Your certificate needs to be:

Dated from 1st January 2015

‘Enhanced’ (it will state this at the top)

Children’s Barred List checked (it should not say ‘none requested’)

If your certificate meets these requirements, please upload a colour scanned/photographed copy of the whole certificate (front and back pages) to the Essential Information page of your staffing application

Any questions?

It’s urgent that you get your DBS sorted as soon as possible to avoid missing out on work this summer. If you have any queries about the DBS application, or your existing DBS certificate please get in touch with your local staffing team or contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.

Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
