Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Remember! You need to get your seasonal roles application in by our upcoming deadline to ensure that you&apos;re fast-tracked through our screening stage. Fast-tracking your application gives you the very best chance of getting the role and location you want this summer.

As it&apos;s a Bank Holiday weekend, we&apos;ve extended the deadline to the 2nd May! Get your application in by Midnight on Monday and we&apos;ll fast-track your application.

Why should you submit your application now?

In the interest of fairness, we allocate our seasonal roles on a first-come, first-served basis. Getting your application in by the end of the month means that:

You’ll be more likely to be offered one of our seasonal roles
You’ll have a better choice of assessment dates to choose from
You’ll have a better choice of dates and locations in the summer
