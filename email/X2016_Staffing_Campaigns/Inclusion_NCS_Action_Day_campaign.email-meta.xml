Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope you have had a lovely start to 2016 and looking forward to returning to work with us on NCS in the summer! In the meantime we have an exciting opportunity coming up next month, with a major event running across the country requiring Support Workers and Personal Coaches.


NCS Action Day: 5 March 2016

NCS Action Day is a day devoted to the celebration of social action made up of various activities led by NCS grads. In order for all NCS Graduates to be able to attend and fully participate throughout the day, we will need your help.

Each Action Day event is organised by the local programmes team, and hours of work will vary by location - but is likely to be between 5 - 8 hours.


Sounds great! What do I need to do?

If you are interested in resuming your role at an NCS Action Day on Saturday 5th March for up to eight hours work (£10 per hour), please let us know by completing this one minute survey. We can then get back to you with a placement and match you to a young person. Please note: spaces on these events will be limited, and roles will be allocated depending on each young person’s needs.

Survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JV7HSL7

If you have any other questions or would just like to get in touch with our team, please email inclusion.staffing@the-challenge.org.


Best wishes,

The Inclusion Staffing Team
