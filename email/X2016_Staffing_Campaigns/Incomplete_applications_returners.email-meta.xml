ALUMNI 2016 - FAST TRACK YOUR APPLICATION!

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Our 2016 seasonal roles are filling up fast, and we’ve noticed that you haven’t submitted your application to work with us yet! As a returning member of staff with great feedback, we’d love to work with you again this year.

We’ve revamped the application process for returners this year. You’ll find that a lot of the application form has been pre-filled for you, and if you’re applying for the same role as last year you’ll get to skip assessment and attend only one day of training in the summer!

As always, we are allocating our roles on a first-come, first-served basis - as such we’d recommend getting your application in as soon as possible. This will ensure that:

You have the best choice of work dates and locations in the summer
You’ll be first in line to be allocated one of our roles
You’ll get first pick of dates for your specialised returner training

What’s more, alumni applications submitted before our 30th April deadline will be fast-tracked!

Our application form is available in different formats! If you have additional needs and would like us to make our application process more accessible to you, please contact our Inclusion Staffing team on inclusion.ss@the-challenge.org as soon as possible.

If you have any other questions about the application process, please get in touch with us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org. We look forward to receiving your application!


Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
