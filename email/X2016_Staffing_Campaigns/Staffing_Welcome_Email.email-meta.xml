Welcome to the NCS Summer 2016 Programme

You’re just ten days from embarking on a fun and rewarding journey with us on NCS this summer - we can’t wait to start working with you!

But First… 

Our NCS Programmes Team will be on ‘on the ground’ for the duration of the programme and will be your first point of contact from Personal Challenge Kick Off on your first wave. You’re in good hands! 

To make your transition on to the programme as smooth as possible, our Programmes Team will be calling you three or four days before you’re due to start. If you know you’ll be unavailable during this period, please contact me with an alternative time that is suitable for you.

What else? 

Contracts: If you haven’t yet ‘signed’ your contract, please do so immediately! Log into the staffing website. Your contract and employment terms and conditions can be found in the ‘Contracts and Timetables’ section of your application. 

Here you will also find your role guide and wave dates, please make yourself familiar with both of these and if you notice any problems with your wave dates, please let me know immediately.  

Health, Safety and Inclusion: If you have not yet completed your HS&amp;I please do so immediately. To ensure the programme is safe for you and everyone you’ll be working with, it’s essential that we have your Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion information as soon as possible. Log into the staffing website and head to the Essential Information section. Once you’re on the ‘Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion’ section, please read the instructions carefully and complete your information. Please make sure you read the consent statement carefully before clicking ‘I agree’.
	
If you would like to discuss the Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion form, you can  contact our Inclusion Staffing team on inclusion.ss@the-challenge.org. 

We cannot let you work on the programme without this information. 

Any questions?

If you have any other questions regarding your role, please get in touch with me.

See you at kick-off!

Best wishes,
Your Staffing Associate 


THANKS AGAIN! THE STAFFING TEAM
