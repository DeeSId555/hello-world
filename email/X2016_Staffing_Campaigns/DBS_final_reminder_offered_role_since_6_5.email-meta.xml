Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The first wave of our NCS summer prgoramme kicks off in less than a week, so it&apos;s all systems go for our seasonal staff members right now. Before you get too excited though, we need to make sure you have a valid DBS well before your wave kicks off. This is a legal requirement and we can&apos;t let you work on the programme without it.

Already have a valid certificate?

If you already have a DBS certificate, please first check it&apos;s valid. Your certificate needs to be:

Dated from 1st January 2015
&apos;Enhanced&apos; (it will state this at the top)
Children&apos;s Barred List checked (it should not say &apos;not requested&apos;)

If your certificate meets these requirements, please upload a colour scanned/photograhped copy of the whole certificate (front and back pages) to the Essential Information page on your staffing portal.

Need to apply for a new DBS?

Follow these instructions to apply for a new certificate through GB Group
You&apos;ll need up to four forms of ID to hand
DBS applications can take up to six weeks to process - please start your application as soon as possible and ensure you get your documents verified at the Post Office by 17th June to avoid delays.

Any questions?

It&apos;s urgent that you get your DBS sorted as soon as possible to avoid missing out on work with summer. If you have any queries about the DBS application process, or your existing DBS certificate please get in touch with your local staffing team or contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.

Best wishes,

The Staffing Team
