Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You can now book onto training for your role on the staffing website!

Returning Practitioners only need to attend a 3-hour session to re-introduce you to the NCS programme and your skills curriculum. This training is a compulsory part of all our seasonal roles, and we can’t let you work on the programme without completing it.

What do I need to do?

Head to the staffing website now and go to the ‘Booking Training’ page to see a list of possible training dates.

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx

To choose select either ‘register’ or ‘decline’ for the date you can attend.

If you can’t make any of the dates offered to you, or if no dates are available, contact your local staffing team as soon as possible.

Our training sessions (especially those taking place over weekends) tend to book up very quickly. Make sure you choose your dates and ‘submit’ them as soon as possible to avoid losing your place!

Any questions?

If you’d like to find out more about our training sessions and what they’ll cover, you can find information on our FAQs otherwise you can call your local staffing team.

We look forward to see you again at training!

Best wishes,
