5 minutes with... Emily Bowyer

Occupation: Project Leader specialising in community development
My last role on NCS was... I was a Programme Leader in Autumn 2015, and I&apos;ve also worked in the Staffing Team as a core staff member.
This year on NCS I will... I&apos;m going to be a PL again this summer, and I&apos;m going to have a lot of games up my sleeve for those quiet moments.
Most rewarding part of NCS: When the young people no longer need to be led. They&apos;ve gone from strangers to friends, supporting each other through the programme.
Most challenging part: Keeping the attention of 60 young people, especially when trying to relay important (but tedious) information.
When I&apos;m not working on NCS, you will find me... Planning my next trip away, working on a new project, or eating.
NCS soundtrack? &apos;Hotline Bling&apos; by Drake. Clearly the content has nothing to do with NCS, but the young people played it all the time!
