Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for applying to be a Leader on the NCS summer programme. We&apos;re now halfway through the summer programme, and have offered more than 5,000 seasonal roles since applications opened in December.

We have now fully recruited all of our roles for this summer, including the Programme Leader and Assistant Programme Leader roles which remained open for a little longer than the others. We have received an unprecedented amount of interest in these roles, and unfortunately we don&apos;t have capacity to run any more assessments or training events for additional staff members. As a result, we are regrettably unable to consider any more applications for this season.

We will be closing the application form for our seasonal roles this week, and you will be unable to continue with your application for the summer programme. Please see below for information on applying for a role on our Autumn programme.

NCS Autumn programme

In October we&apos;ll be recruiting Leaders and Practitioners for our NCS autumn programme. When we commence recruitment for autumn in September, you&apos;ll be able to pick up and continue your application where you left it, as long as you have indicated in the &apos;My Profile&apos; section that you&apos;re able to work in &apos;Autumn&apos;.

We&apos;ll be in touch later in the summer with more information on the autumn programme.


Thank you again for your interest in the NCS programme. We hope to be able to work with you soon!


Best wishes,
