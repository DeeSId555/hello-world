Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on being offered a role with us this summer! Before we can allocate a work placement for you, we need some important information to ensure your suitability to work on the programme and your safety. The ‘Essential Information’ section is now open - this section is made up of the following pages:

Disclosure &amp; Barring Service
References
Health, safeguarding &amp; inclusion
Bank &amp; tax information (from April 2016)
Emergency contact details

Follow this link to go to the Essential Information page: https://staffing.the-challenge.org/secure/EssentialInformation.aspx


Disclosure &amp; Barring Service

You must have a valid ‘Enhanced DBS with Children’s Barred check’ dated from 1 January 2015 to work on the programme. If you already have a DBS which fits this criteria, now’s the time to upload a scanned or photographed copy to the ‘Disclosure and Barring Service section via the ‘Upload Existing DBS’ button. Alternatively, follow the instructions on your job-offer email as soon as possible to apply for a new one (if you haven’t already!).


References

All seasonal staff need to have two satisfactory references. If you have worked with us in 2015 we will use your feedback from last year for you, but you will need to provide contact details for an additional referee who can confirm your suitability to work on the programme. If you’re a new member of staff, you’ll need to provide contact details for two referees. Further information on suitable referees can be found on the ‘References’ page.


Health, safeguarding &amp; inclusion

New for 2016 - we’ve created a new Health, Safeguarding &amp; inclusion form which all seasonal staff need to fill out as fully and honestly as possible. We’ll use this information to ensure the safety of both you and others whilst you’re working on the programme. If you want to disclose further information on any additional needs you might have, you can talk to our Inclusion Staffing team confidentially on inclusion.ss@the-challenge.org.


Bank &amp; tax information

From April 2016 we’ll ask you to provide us with (a) your bank details, and (b) either a tax declaration or your P45 form. We’ll use this information to make sure that you’re paid appropriately for your role.


Emergency contact details

We need contact details for your next of kin, just in case of emergency whilst you’re on the programme. These need to be up-to-date when you start your role.



What else?

From March, you’ll be able to choose which ‘waves’ you’d like to work on in the summer, and from April you’ll be given a range of training dates to choose from. Until then, please make your way through the DBS, references and health, safeguarding and inclusion pages of the Essential Information section. If you need any further information these pages, please check out our FAQs or contact your local staffing team.

Thanks in advance for getting all your essential information to us - we’ll be in touch soon when you can enter your availability!


Best wishes,

The Staffing team
