Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The NCS summer programme starts in less than two months, and you have not yet supplied a valid DBS certificate.

If you do not have one we will have to withdraw you from any waves you are allocated to, and you will not be entitled to compensation.

The copy of your certificate which you uploaded to the staffing application website has been found to be invalid. This could be because:

The scanned or photographed image was blurry or unclear, OR

Your certificate is out of date, OR

Your certificate is not an ‘Enhanced DBS’ with ‘Children’s Barred List’ checked


Copy was blurry or unclear - what to do now

If the copy of your certificate was deemed blurry or unclear (status F), you just need to upload a new copy to the staffing website. Please make sure the new image is in colour, shows both sides of the certificate (in full), and as clear as possible. Please upload a new copy by 8th May 2016.

Out-of-date certificate - what to do now

If your current certificate is out of date (if it’s older than 1st January 2015), you will need to apply for a new certificate through our partners GB Group.

Please follow these instructions on how to apply for a DBS. You will need up to four forms of ID to hand, and following the online application you’ll need to take your documents to the post office to be verified - please do this by 15th May 2016.

Wrong level of certificate - what to do now

We require candidates to have ‘Enhanced’ DBS certificates with ‘Children Barred List checked’ (this should not read ‘none requested). If your certificate does not meet these requirements, you’ll need to apply for a new certificate through our partners GB Group.

Please follow these instructions on how to apply for a DBS. You will need up to four forms of ID to hand, and following the online application you’ll need to take your documents to the post office to be verified - please do this by 15th May 2016.

Any questions?



It’s urgent that you get your DBS sorted as soon as possible to avoid missing out on work this summer. If you have any queries about the DBS application, or your existing DBS certificate please get in touch with your local staffing team or contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.



Best wishes,
