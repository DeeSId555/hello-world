Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope you&apos;ve been keeping well!

Applications to work on the NCS programme this summer are currently open, and we&apos;d love for you to join us again and bring back your expertise, enthusiasm and experience.

We count on our brilliant alumni to help us keep each NCS programme to the same high standard as the last. This year, we&apos;re recruiting more than 4,500 seasonal roles, across more locations than ever before. NCS is growing, and we want you to be a part of it.

Why should you come back to us?

New locations: we&apos;ve expanded and are now providing NCS in Leeds &amp; Bradford, Surrey, and Buckinghamshire &amp; Berkshire, as well as in Greater London, the West Midlands and North-West England.

New roles: we&apos;ve got new inclusion roles which focus on making the NCS programme accessible to even more young people. If your experience lies in supporting people with additional needs or challenging behaviour, these roles are for you. If working 1-2-1 with a young person isn&apos;t your thing, we&apos;ve still got a range of leader, mentor and specialist roles for you to choose from - click here to find out more!

No assessment: as a member of our valued alumni, we know that you&apos;re an excellent candidate for our roles. That means that if you&apos;re joining us again in the same role as before, you&apos;ll be provisionally offered a role straight away, without needing to attend another assessment.


Sounds great! What do I need to do?

To apply to work with us again, you&apos;ll need to log in to the staffing website - don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ve got you on our system already, so just use the email address below and click on the &apos;forgotten password&apos; button to retrieve your password.

Your email: {!Contact.Email}

Then you&apos;ll be able to fill in the &apos;My Profile&apos; page, and then head onto the &apos;My Application&apos; page.

Any questions?

We know a lot has changed since we last worked with you, so if you need to refresh your memory, or find out more about NCS in 2016, please see our FAQs. You can also contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org to get any questions you have answered!

We hope to receive an application from you soon!


Best wishes,
