Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The first wave of the 2016 NCS summer programme kicks off on the 18th June! This year we’ve received an unprecedented number of applications for our seasonal roles, and have offered over 4,500 roles.

But we’re still looking for Leaders….

Having great leaders supporting the programme and directing our young people through their NCS journeys is essential.

We’ve noticed that you haven’t applied to work on the summer programme this year, and are hoping to change your mind. Here are a few reasons why you should join us:

New locations and wave layouts - flexible dates and locations available
Top up your salary over the summer
Reduced training*
Streamlined recruitment process - no need to complete an application form
or assess - just get in touch with us now!

*If you did not attend training with us last year, you’ll need to attend up to 2.5 days of role training.

What do I need to do?

Simply email us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org with your availability and where you’d like to work. We’ll direct you to the correct staffing team who will get you booked onto your training and sort out any outstanding DBS and Right to Work compliance before you start on the programme.

To refresh your memory, the Programme Leader and Assistant Programme Leader role descriptions are available on our website: ncsthechallenge.org/jobs.

Any questions?

If you have any questions about our remaining leader roles and locations, please email us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.

We hope to hear from you soon!

Best wishes,

The Challenge Staffing Team</textOnly>
