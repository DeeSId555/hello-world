Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The first wave of this summer&apos;s NCS programme kicks off in less than two months - before you can start your role, we just need a few more pieces of information from you.

Bank and tax information

The &apos;Bank details&apos; and &apos;Tax information&apos; sections of the Essential Information page are now open for you to complete with your current and up-to-date tax and payment information.

Please log into the staffing website and enter your bank details and make a tax declaration by 20th May 2016. Failure to do so could result in your wage being paid late or incorrectly.

Making a tax declaration

In order to generate a tax code for you, you need to either send us your P45 (please read on) or make a tax declaration. To make a tax declaration, you&apos;ll need to read through three statements, and indicate which statement will be most applicable to your circumstances when your employment with The Challenge commences.

If you are unsure which statement you should choose, select the statement which is most applicable to your current circumstances - it&apos;s better to have submitted something than nothing at all!

Sending in your P45 Form

Alternatively, if you have a P45 Form dated from 6th April 2016 (new tax year), you can simply send it to our payroll partners. Further instructions can be found on the Essential Information page.

What else?

If you haven&apos;t completed your Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion form on the staffing website yet, please ensure you do so as soon as possible. We must have this information before we can allocate you to any work placements.

We&apos;ll use this information to ensure that the NCS programme is safe for both you and others while you&apos;re working with us - anything you disclose will be treated confidentially. To find out more about how we use this information, please see our Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion FAQs.

This information must be filled out on the online form, but if you&apos;d like to discuss any additional needs or safeguarding concerns you might have, you can contact the Inclusion Staffing Team either by email (inclusion.ss@the-challenge.org) or by phone (0203 542 2451).

Any questions?

If you have any questions about the Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion form, please contact our Inclusion Staffing Team using the information above.

We regret that we cannot help with any tax queries - if you&apos;re unsure what tax information you should provide us with, you should contact HMRC directly.

As ever, if you have any general questions about your role or the NCS programme, you can contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.

We look forward to seeing you at training!

The Staffing Team
