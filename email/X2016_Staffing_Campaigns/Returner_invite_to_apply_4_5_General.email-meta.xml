Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Great news - Applications for the 2016 NCS seasonal programmes are now officially open!
https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx


Last year, due to your incredible commitment, 81% of young people on the programme felt that they gained an understanding of what life is like for others, 72% believe that they are more able to trust people from other backgrounds, and 76% feel more confident about the future.Thank you for helping us achieve this!

The application form for our 2016 roles is now available and, given the quality of feedback we have received from our Programmes Team from your work this year, we would love to work with you again.
