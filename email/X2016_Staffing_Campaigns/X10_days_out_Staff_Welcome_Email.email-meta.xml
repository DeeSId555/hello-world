In this issue: what you need to bring to training, update from South-East London Staffing, 5 minutes with Rosie Lovegrove, and more!

Staffing Spotlight on: South East London

April is truly the season of variety and new beginnings here in South-East Staffing. Our days  are filled with a medley of tasks including attraction events (we are still on the hunt for some brilliant male senior mentors and photography practitioners), running assessments and solving the immense jigsaw puzzle that is placing 619(!) staff in their desired locations. The whole team is excited to see everything falling into place, and can’t wait to take on the summer together with our new team member!

Read Emily&apos;s blog post about being a PL for NCS, and her projects in Greece since!

What should I bring to training?

NCS role training kicks off this month - if we haven&apos;t witnessed your (existing) DBS and Right To Work documents yet this year, make sure you bring them to your (first) training session.

If you&apos;re unsure which Right To Work documents to bring, you can check here.

Remember, you only need to bring your DBS with you if you didn&apos;t get it through The Challenge! We&apos;ll make scanned copies of any documents you bring (for our own record).


5 minutes with... Rosie Lovegrove (seasonal staff) Occupation: Creative Freelancer

Last role on NCS: I was a Drama Practitioner in Autumn 2015, and Senior Mentor in Summer 2012.

This year on NCS I will... Hopefully be working as a Practitioner again!

Most rewarding part of NCS: Seeing the young people at our community visits to an old people&apos;s home - scared at first, and then wholly involved and passionate about making a difference for the elderly.

Most challenging part: Keeping the young people&apos;s attention in the skills workshops. You&apos;ve got 12 young people with very different views and interests, and you need to be constantly adapting and making sure they&apos;re all engaged and enjoying learning your skill.

When I&apos;m not working on NCS, you will find me... Collaborating on various projects - from community work with the Old Vic theatre, to playing a mad professor for a science show; or planning my wedding!

What&apos;s the soundtrack to your NCS experience? &apos;You are the sunshine of my life&apos; by Stevie Wonder. An elderly man at one of our community visits performed this for us - it was lovely!

Thanks Rosie! Our Practitioner roles are the perfect opportunity to share your skills and inspire young people to try something new - know someone who&apos;s got what it takes? Send them to our website.

Debate Mate
Debate Mate is a global education charity that works in areas of high poverty at some of the most deprived schools in the UK. We employ uni students to mentor from November to April, teaching debating to primary and secondary school students. Our programmes raise speaking and listening attainment, and improve skills such as confidence, resilience and teamwork. In doing so, it addresses the widening skills gap between education and employment.
Aside from our core after-school programme, we also offer bespoke student &amp; teacher training packages. Find our more here.
