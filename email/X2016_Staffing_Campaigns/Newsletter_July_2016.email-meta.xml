NCS with The Challenge

Email us

&apos;Thanks&apos; from Head of Programmes (South) Tim Bevans

&quot;Last month saw the first of over 30,000 young people begin their NCS adventure with The Challenge. Their expectations, hopes and fears will all be different, but every single one of them will take something away from the programme, and this is in a large part down to our fantastic seasonal staff..

My first involvement with NCS was as a Programme Leader last year. It was evident to me that NCS is a programme that can make a real difference, and I made the decision to leave 20 years in education behind to take on the role of Head of Programmes (South) for The Challenge.

I would like to thank everyone who has delivered, or is about to deliver, on the NCS programme. I know it involves hard work, late nights, perseverance and occasional disappointment - but it&apos;s also one of the most rewarding experiences you will ever have.&quot;

Find out more from Tim about the impact of the NCS programme below.

The Challenge does London Pride
Saturday 25th June saw the streets of London flooded with people celebrating LGBT+ rights, and The Challenge got stuck in! In the wake of the attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando the spirit was one of solidarity with a mix of celebratory Pride colour!

#PostRefUnity
Reports on hate crimes have been rising since the EU Referendum, and we need your help fighting this - find a friend who voted differently to you and take a selfie together. Share it on social media with @seasonalstaff &amp; @TheChallenge_UK
using the hashtag #PostRefUnity.

[The] referendum result and the immediate aftermath have highlighted our differences as a nation. Now we must seek to understand our differences and find the things that unite us... Continue reading.

Impact of the NCS programme
&quot;The impact of the programme may not be immediate - for some young people, it could be 10 years down the line when they have the opportunity to make a decision or take on leadership that will make a difference to a community. These are the future leaders and advocates of social integration. These are the people who will build better futures for the next generation. They will do this because of your efforts, dedication &amp; commitment.&quot;

10 things it might be an idea to pack for NCS this summer

Rosie tells us all about being a Practitioner on the NCS progrmame (below)

5 Minutes With... Rosie Lovegrove

Occupation: Creative Freelancer
My last role on NCS was... Drama Practitioner in 2015 and Senior Mentor in 2012.
Most rewarding thing about NCS: Seeing the young people at the community visits - scared at first, then wholly involved and passionate about making a difference for others.
Most challenging part: You&apos;ve got 12 young people, and you need to engage them all at once; staying on your toes and adapting to new situations and people.
This year on NCS I will... Hopefully be a Practitioner again!
When I&apos;m not working on NCS you&apos;ll find me... Collaborating on multiple projects or planning my wedding!
