A BIG THANK YOU TO THIS YEAR&apos;S STAFF

We still have an all-important RCA weekend for our autumn programme to go, but as of Monday, all of the 2015 NCS programmes will officially be done and dusted! Now more than 27,000 young people will have graduated from the NCS programme in 2015 alone. This is an absolutely incredible achievement and we are in awe of the sheer talent, skill and dedication that each of you brought to our biggest and best programme yet.

Impact of NCS 2015!

We know that, by the end of the programme, our staff have put in absolutely everything they have, and we want to show you that all your effort and enthusiasm will have a lasting impact on both young people and their communities.

Following the programme, young people rated how NCS has affected them:

• 72% felt they were &quot;more able to trust people&quot;
• 88% felt that they were better at working in a team
• 71% felt that they were better at leading people
• 76% felt more confident about getting a job in the future

Here&apos;s what this year&apos;s young people had to say about NCS:

&quot;NCS is the best thing I have ever done, and trust me; they are not kidding when they say &apos;once in a lifetime&apos;! The friends you make are for life (you literally can&apos;t get rid of them). It&apos;s an awesome experience which I would gladly do again&quot;

&quot;NCS helped me to form real relationships with people I would never have chosen to even speak to in the past. I learnt to relate to people who were different to me and show understanding and empathy towards people with different life experiences

Give us your feedback!

Last but not least, we&apos;d still love to hear about your experiences this summer and autumn - remember to share your stories with @seasonalstaff on Twitter, or on our Seasonal Staff Facebook page!

For those alumni who weren&apos;t able to work this year - hopefully you&apos;re feeling a twinge of nostalgia and you&apos;re inspired to come back and work with us again in 2016!

HELP US SPREAD THE WORD - SUMMER 2016

Applications for the NCS 2016 summer programme are set to open in mid-December, and we&apos;re looking to our fantastic alumni workforce to help us spread the word as far as possible!

Next summer is set to be bigger than ever as we grow by almost a third! We now have new locations and roles for you to choose from; you can now work in Leeds, Bradford or Wakefield alongside our new Yorkshire team. We&apos;re also working hard to reach out to as many young people as possible, and our new Inclusion roles will provide extra support to young people with additional needs.

We&apos;ll be in touch when applications are open - we&apos;d love to work with you again in 2016. In the meantime, if you think any of your friends, family or colleagues would love to join, please refer them to our website where they can read more and sign up from December!

CHECK OUT THE &apos;LONDONERS STORIES&apos; PAGE ON FACEBOOK

&apos;Londoners Stories&apos; is a public page on Facebook dedicated to publishing the heart-warming &apos;good news&apos; stories of random strangers all across London. It&apos;s creator Francis, one of our amazing photography practitioners, updates the page weekly, and has recently started uploading stories from other seasonal staff members to highlight just how much the NCS programme affects both young people and their supporting staff.

Here are a couple of the stories from the programme:

&quot;The biggest lesson I learnt is the difference a change in environment can make... Young people doubt themselves far too much and do not give themselves enough credit. I found how privileged and happy the young people were to learn new things from a different group of people.&quot;

&quot;I will always remember the day when [my team] came in on the first day... They were scared and nervous. The transformation that they made individually and with each other to become one unit was amazing.&quot;

Go ahead and have a look at the page - and maybe even send in your own &apos;good news&apos; story! Here&apos;s what Francis has to say about his project:

&quot;Simply being a photographer and someone who loved &apos;humans&apos; - as weird as that sounds - made me want to create some kind of platform where I can share people&apos;s stories. From long, heart-warming stories, to light, easy ones, I just wanted to do something that allowed me to do something in that vein. It&apos;s the scariest thing, going up to random people and asking them questions and for a photo to be taken of them. Nonetheless, it&apos;s worked out really well. It also encourages me to take my camera everywhere, which is great for every photographer!&quot;

We want to hear all about your experiences outside of London too! If anyone in Manchester, Lancashire, Yorkshire or the West Midlands is interested in writing and publishing a blog post or a testimonial, please get in touch with your  local staffing team.
