Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Great news - Applications for the 2016 NCS seasonal programmes are now officially open!

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fsecure%2f

Last year, due to your incredible commitment, 81% of young people on the programme felt that they gained an understanding of what life is like for others, 72% believe that they are more able to trust people from other backgrounds, and 76% feel more confident about the future. Thank you for helping us achieve this!.

2016 seasonal roles

Unfortunately, we will no longer be using Community Facilitators in the 2016 NCS programmes -  however, following your excellent work in 2015, we’d like you to apply for the Assistant Programme Leader role!

Please note that depending on which role you decide to apply for, you may be asked to attend one of our group assessments in the new year.

Applications now open!

Please login to the staffing website using your existing username and password, and ensure that your personal details on the ‘My Profile’ section are up-to-date before starting your application.

Some of your application form will have been pre-filled for you with responses from last year’s application - however, depending on which role(s) you decide to go for, you will need to answer a range of new role-specific questions later in the form.

Any questions?

If you have any questions about our 2016 roles, or which role to apply for, please don’t hesitate to contact your local staffing team.

*Please note that the Staffing Department will be closing on Wednesday 23rd December until the 4th of January. All queries during this period will be picked up on our return. Have a great festive break from all of us in the staffing team!
