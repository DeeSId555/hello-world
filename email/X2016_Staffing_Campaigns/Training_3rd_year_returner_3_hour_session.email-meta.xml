Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You can now book onto training for your NCS seasonal role! Training is a compulsory part of all our seasonal roles, and we can’t let you work on the programme without completing it.

If you’re taking on the same role again for the third year in a row (e.g. you have been an SM in 2014 and 2015, and will do this role again this summer), you are eligible to attend our 3-hour returner training session on one of the following dates.

Birmingham - 19 May 2016

Leeds - 21 May 2016

London - 21 May 2016

Manchester/Lancashire - 22 May 2016

London - 1 June 2016

Places on our shorter training sessions are limited. If you are too late to book onto one of these sessions or can’t make any of these sessions, you will need to attend a full day of returner training instead. You can book onto the full day on the Staffing Website

What do I need to do?

The three-hour sessions cannot be booked via the Staffing Website, so you’ll need to call your local staffing team directly to book onto an this session. If cannot attend this session, you will need to attend the full day of returner training, please book this on the staffing website.

Our training tends to fill up very quickly, so make sure you get in touch with your staffing team as soon as possible to secure your place!

Any questions?

If you’d like to find out more about our training sessions and what they’ll cover, you can find information on our FAQs otherwise you can call your local staffing team.

We look forward to seeing you again at training!

Best wishes,
