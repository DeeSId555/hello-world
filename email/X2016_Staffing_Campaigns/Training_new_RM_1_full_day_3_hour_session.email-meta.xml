Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You can now book onto training for your role on the staffing website!

Residential Mentors are required to attend both (1)  a three-hour session to brief you on the NCS programme and our safeguarding procedures, and (2) a full day of role-specific training (including half a day of First Aid training). This training is a compulsory part of all our seasonal roles, and we can’t let you work on the programme without completing it.

What do I need to do?

Head to the staffing website now and go to the ‘Booking Training’ page to see a list of possible training dates.

https://staffing.the-challenge.org/Login.aspx

You must respond to all dates offered to you - select either ‘register’ or ‘decline’ for each date.

You need to attend your training sessions in the right order (e.g. Day 1 then Day 2).

If you can’t make any of the dates offered to you, or if no dates are available, contact your local staffing team as soon as possible.

Our training sessions (especially those taking place over weekends) tend to book up very quickly. Make sure you choose your dates and ‘submit’ them as soon as possible to avoid losing your place!

Food Safety Training

On top of your role training, you are also required to complete an online Food and Safety course ahead of starting your role. Your staffing team will be in touch soon with further information on this.

Any questions?

If you’d like to find out more about our training sessions and what they’ll cover, you can find information on our FAQs otherwise you can call your local staffing team.

We look forward to seeing you again at training!

Best wishes,
