Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The first wave of our 2016 National Citizen Service Summer Programme kicks off on 18th June!

Applications for our summer roles have been open since December, and we’ve received an unprecedented amount of interest. We have now filled the majority of the roles in most locations around the country - we just have a number of leader roles left to fill!

How can you help?

The young person’s overall experience and the impact of the programme is proven to be enhanced by the presence of high quality returning staff who can bring their invaluable experience to the project.

Last year you received positive feedback as a leader on NCS and we would love for you to work with us again this summer to help inspire the next round of young people - 38,000 in total! We are urgently seeking confident and experienced Programme Leaders and Assistant Programme Leaders for a number of waves and locations.

We’ve noticed that you haven’t applied to work on the summer programme this year, and are hoping to change your mind. Here are a few reasons why you should join us on NCS this year:

We have over 4,500 roles, making 2016 our biggest year to date!
New locations and wave layouts - flexible dates and locations
Top up your salary over the summer
Reduced training - attend one day of returner training
Immediate start if you have a valid DBS and First Aid from last year
Streamlined recruitment process - no need to complete an application form
or assess - just get in touch with us now!

What do you need to do?

Simply email us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org with the approximate dates and locations you can work we’ll direct you to the correct local staffing team who will get you booked onto your training and check your DBS and Right to Work compliance before you start on the programme.

To refresh your memory, the Programme Leader and Assistant Programme Leader role descriptions are available on our website: ncsthechallenge.org/jobs.

Any questions?

If you have any questions about the process or about the NCS programme itself, please contact us on our general helpline: seasonalroles@the-challenge.org. You can also find information on our FAQs.

We hope to hear from you soon!

Best wishes,

The Challenge Staffing Team</textOnly>
