Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Hope you are well - we&apos;re looking forward to meeting you at your assessment!

Earlier today, we accidentally sent you a second email inviting you to book onto one of our group assessments. This email was sent out in error - please don&apos;t worry, you&apos;re still booked onto your chosen assessment.

We&apos;re sorry for any confusion caused by this email - if you would like to double check your assessment details, please login to the staffing website and head to the &apos;Booking Assessments&apos; page for a summary of your upcoming event.

If you have any questions about your booked assessment please get in touch with your local staffing team or check out our FAQs!

Apologies again for any confusion or inconvenienced caused. See you at your assessment!

Best wishes,

The Challenge Staffing team
