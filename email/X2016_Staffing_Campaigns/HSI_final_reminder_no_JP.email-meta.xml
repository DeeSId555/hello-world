Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

With less than a month to go before the NCS programme kicks off, it’s time to make sure that you’ve given us all of your ‘Essential Information’. We’ve noticed that you haven’t submitted your ‘Health, Safeguarding &amp; Inclusion’ form yet. Please note that we won’t be able to offer you any work placements until we have this information.

We must have your Health, Safeguarding &amp; Inclusion information by Thursday 2nd June!

What do I need to do?

Please log into the staffing website and head to the Essential Information section. Once you’re on the ‘Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion’ section, please read the instructions carefully and fill out your information.

Please make sure you read the consent statement carefully before clicking ‘I agree’.

How is this information used?

We will use this information to ensure that the NCS programme is safe for both you and everyone you’ll be working with, and to make any reasonable adjustments to the programme where necessary. For instance, if you have any allergies or dietary requirements, these will be passed onto any catering providers we use.

Anything you disclose will be treated confidentially. For more information on how this information is used, please see our FAQs.

If you would like to discuss the Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion form, you can contact our Inclusion Staffing team on inclusion.ss@the-challenge.org.

Any questions?

If you have any queries about the Health, Safeguarding and Inclusion form, you can contact Inclusion Staffing on the email address above. Additionally, if you have any questions regarding your role, please get in touch with us as usual on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org.


Best wishes,



The Challenge Staffing  Team</textOnly>
