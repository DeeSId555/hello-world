Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for applying to work on our NCS summer programme this year. We’ve received over 25,000 applications for our roles, and we’re looking forward to the programme kicking-off in just under a month.

We apologise for the delay in responding to your application. We screen our candidates on a first come, first served basis. Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming number of applications we have received this year, we regret to advise that it is unlikely we will be able to consider your application for a role with us this summer.

Our seasonal roles are now limited, but we wanted to let you know that if we are unable to consider you for a role with us this summer, we will keep your details and contact you when recruitment for our upcoming autumn programme commences.

Which roles have been filled?

The following roles are now fully recruited for:

Support Worker
Personal Coach
Learning and Behaviour Mentor
Residential Mentor
Programme Administrator

There are only a limited number of Senior Mentor roles available, although we are still recruiting for several other roles including Programme Leader and Senior Community Facilitator. Your application will be considered for these other positions, and if successful, we will be in touch in the coming weeks.

The NCS Autumn Programme

If we are not able to review your application for the summer programme, your application will be put ‘on hold’ and will remain in our system for when we begin recruitment for our autumn programme.

The NCS Autumn programme is a condensed version of our summer programme and takes place over one week during the October half term (17 - 28 October), and continues over the following November weekends. This year we will be looking for roughly 1,200 seasonal staff to support the Autumn programme nationally.

Recruitment for the Autumn programme will begin in August/September; we’ll be in touch with more information later in the summer.

If you are interested in working on the autumn programme, but didn’t indicate so on your application, please head to the ‘My Profile page, and select ‘autumn’ under ‘When can you work’.

Any questions?

We’ll contact you directly if we’re able to offer you any of our remaining summer roles, so there’s no need to get in touch to find out if you’re successful. If you have any questions about the autumn programme, please do contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org however please note that we will not be able to respond to any queries over the bank holiday weekend.

Again, we apologise for any delay in responding to your application, and hope that we can work with you in the future.

Best wishes,

The Challenge Staffing Team</textOnly>
