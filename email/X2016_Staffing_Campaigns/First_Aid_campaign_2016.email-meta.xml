Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



This week we will be launching our role training - we’ll be in touch when the staffing website is ready for you to book onto your training dates.



In addition to role training, Programme Leaders and Assistant Programme Leaders are required to have valid First Aid training before they can work on the NCS programme.



I already have a First Aid certificate



If you have a First Aid certificate valid from the 1st September 2013 or later, you need to send a scanned or photographed copy to your local staffing team within 5 days.



Is my First Aid certificate valid?



Please note that we require your First Aid training to have covered the following::

drowning

diabetes

epilepsy

defibrillation (awareness only – not practical)

CPR

burns,

bleeding

anaphylaxis




There is a three year validity period for all first aid training. If your certificate is dated from 1st September 2013 or later and your training covered the above criteria, you won’t need to attend one of our First Aid training sessions.



If you received first aid training, but not in the above areas, or if your existing First Aid certificate is now out of date, you will need to attend one of our tailor-made First Aid training sessions - please read on.




I don’t have a valid First Aid certificate



We’re running several First Aid training sessions in London, Birmingham, Reading, Preston, Manchester and Leeds in the run-up to the start of the NCS programme. If you do not have a valid certificate, your local staffing team will be calling you to book you onto one our first aid training sessions.



Any questions?



If you’re not sure if your current First Aid certificate is valid, or would like to discuss our First Aid training with us in more detail, don’t hesitate to get in touch - email us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org for more information.



Best Wishes,
