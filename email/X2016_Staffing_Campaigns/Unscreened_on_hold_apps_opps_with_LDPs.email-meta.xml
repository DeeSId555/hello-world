Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Once again, we wanted to thank you for applying to work on our NCS summer programme this year. This year, we received an unprecedented number of applications for our NCS summer programme, and regrettably have been unable to consider all of them for this our summer 2016 programme.

While our own NCS seasonal roles have been filled, we wanted to let you know of some staffing opportunities with our local NCS delivery partners. They still have a number of roles available on the summer programme all over the country.

Who are our local delivery partners?

Our local delivery partners run the NCS Summer programme for us in certain areas in Hampshire, Buckinghamshire, Birmingham, the West Midlands and Yorkshire. The programme follows the same format as NCS with The Challenge but job roles may differ slightly. Please visit the job descriptions on our local partner websites below for more information and to apply:

In the interim, please ensure you’ve indicated your interest for the Autumn programme on your staffing application - head to the ‘My Profile page, and select ‘Autumn’ under ‘When can you work’.

Any questions?

As ever, please contact us on seasonalroles@the-challenge.org if you have any questions.

We hope you have a great summer, and hope to work with you in the near future.

Best wishes,
