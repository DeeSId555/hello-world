Absence Request Form



Dear Parent/Guardian {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for letting us know you need to ask for {!Contact.FirstName} to have an absence from NCS (National Citizen Service).

You now need to fill in a form to provide full details of your absence request. You can do this by clicking here.

Please note that participants cannot be absent for more than:

one day of a half term programme
or
two days of a summer programme.

Young people may need to make up the hours missed by independently volunteering so they can graduate and receive their certificate. If this applies to your young person, they will be told how many hours they need to make up during NCS and we will send you an email. You and the young person will then need to organise some volunteering which aims to benefit the environment or community.

If you are unable to fill in this form online, please email us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org or call us on 0203 542 2400 to request a paper version.

If you have any questions, please take a look at our Questions page or get in touch with us on the details above.



Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
