    <subject>Introducing Step Forward</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

As a valued partner of The Challenge we have appreciated your support and would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to an exciting new apprenticeship programme we have launched called Step Forward.

Step Forward helps employers recruit fantastic school leavers and we would love to offer your organisation the chance to hire eager and enthusiastic apprentices. Some of the organisations we currently work with are Thomson Reuters, New Look and Comic Relief.

Step Forward is popular as it provides a great new member of staff at a very reasonable price while also, helping your place of work to do something positive about youth unemployment.

Our apprentices can work in a variety of roles including: administration, IT, finance and social media. Our professional day-release training helps to develop skills and leads to further their qualifications.

We have received interest from over 4,000 18-year-old&apos;s this year for just 200 places. The process is very simple as we work to find you the best three candidates for your vacancy â€“ all you do is pick one.

Sound good? If you would to find out more please email us at:
sf.employers@the-challenge.org and one of our account managers will get in touch with you.

Best Wishes,

The Step Forward Team
