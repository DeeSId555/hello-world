    <subject>The Challenge needs you!</subject>
    <textOnly>It is now almost 1 year since your child took part in the National Citizen Service with The Challenge. Over the last 5 years, 50,000 young people have said yes to this opportunity and loved it.

We want to let you know about an exiciting new opportunity we have - but this time it&apos;s aimed at you. Or - at least - your place of work.

We have recently launched Step Forward, our new apprenticeship programme which helps employers recruit fantastic school leavers and we would love to offer this opportunity to your organisation. Some organisations we have on board are Thomson Reuters, New Look and Comic Relief.

Step Forward is popular as it provides a great new member of staff at a very reasonable price while also, helping your place of work to do something positive about youth unemployment.

Our apprentices can work in a variety of roles including: administration, IT, finance and social media. Our professional day-release training develops skills and leads to further their qualifications.

We have received interest from over 4,000 18-year-old&apos;s this year for just 200 places. The process is very simple as we work to find you the best three candidates â€“ all you do is pick one.

Sound good? If you would like your place of work to consider hiring a Step Forward apprentice, we&apos;re happy to have a chat or send you more information.
