Our Associates Tell All

So, what&apos;s it really like to be on Step Forward? We spoke to Emily our Associate at Thomson Reuters, a multinational company that works in over 100 countries. Here’s what she had to say…

“The biggest surprise is feeling like you are really respected by the people you work with and that you are a crucial part of the team”

-Emily, Step Forward Associate





Step Forward is… starting my working life by helping me to put my foot in the world of work.

The Training. I take part in Step Forward training every Thursday. I have really enjoyed our 5 week project called ’Make your Mark-et’ which is a chance to work in a group, develop skills and gain some practical experience.  We are creating business plans and will be able to sell the product or service in a few weeks’ time.

The Job. My responsibilities include sorting out new starters and leavers, recruitment and interviews. The best day in my job so far was when I had a conference call with one of our colleagues in America. I also got to be involved in the charity boat race at Canary Wharf after my first few weeks.

Best wishes,
