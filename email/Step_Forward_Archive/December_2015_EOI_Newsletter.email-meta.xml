An Associate Tells All

Roisin is a Step Forward Associate on the Early Years Education Pathway and also writes for the Step Forward blog. In this excerpt of her latest post, Roisin shares why she decided to join Step Forward.

&quot;After perhaps the 20th pros and cons list, I decided that Step Forward would be the best option for me as I didn’t feel quite ready to go to university and anyway, it couldn’t hurt to earn some extra qualifications (and cash!). I threw myself into the rest of the process, and was extremely lucky to find myself accepted onto the programme as an Early Years Education Associate...&quot;

Does this sound like you? If want to read more of Roisin’s amazing post and get some more hints, tips and stories read our blog.


Meet the Mentors

All Associates on Step Forward receive expert guidance and support  from a fully trained mentor. Vicky talks about her experience working with our current Associates.

Vicky Johnson

I became a mentor because… I ran the NCS summer  programme for 3 summers and absolutely loved my job. I  found that the aspect I enjoyed most was spending time with  the young people, seeing them grow and develop and  helping them overcome challenges and celebrating their  successes with them.

My favourite part of the job is…the journey I go on with  the Associates, through their challenges, through their  successes and seeing how far they have all come.

The highlight of my year? Wow that&apos;s a hard one! There have been so many! The main highlight, I think, is watching your Associates grow as people. They have all come such a long way and it’s been amazing to be a part of that.

My number one tip for anyone about to start the programme is…get as much out of the programme as you can! There are endless opportunities and they are yours for the taking! Meet as many people as possible, reflect often, be open-minded and lastly...enjoy it!

Behind The Scenes With Our Employers

We have Associates working in companies across London; from small (and perfectly formed) start-ups in Clapham to bustling businesses in Old Street with a view over the city. But what are the employers really like? We sat down with a few of them to pick their brains about the programme. Below is an extract and you can read lots more employer profiles on our blog.


Drew is a brand agency. Their output involves everything from print through to spatial graphics, packaging and digital media.

“We are giving our Step Forward Associate an alternative viewpoint on what an office is”
- Stephen Walker, Drew London




The Job. Kimberley runs the Drew office like a well-oiled machine. She helps out with running the financial stuff, answers the telephone, sorts out deliveries and we are tasking her with a social media piece we’re doing.

The Future. Kimberley has had a taster of working in a media based office and we’re a small business so you get to see the whole process. Kimberley wants to stay in marketing and she has massive potential.

Our employers are pretty great.  They range from agencies like Drew to crowdfunding platforms; from multinational corporations to charities. To read more employer profiles take a look at our blog.

Our top tip for the Step Forward assessment is ‘try to relax and be professional’. We are looking for Associates who can embody the STEP qualities: responsibility, professionalism, resilience and teamwork. Good luck!

And as always, if you want ask any questions please feel free to get in touch via email, Facebook or Twitter. We’ll be out of the office over Christmas but will get back to you as soon as possible in January.

Enjoy the festive season!
