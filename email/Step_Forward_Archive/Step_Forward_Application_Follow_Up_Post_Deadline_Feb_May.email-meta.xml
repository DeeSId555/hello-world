As we received your application after our final deadline we cannot guarantee you a space on our next assessment happening during February half term. 

Your application has been accepted.  If you are successful and a place on our next assessment becomes available, we will be in touch with further information so keep an eye on your emails over the next couple of weeks.

The assessment is nothing to worry about; itâ€™s just a great opportunity for us to get to know each other a bit better. You can find out more about our application process here. You can also visit our blog for tips on how to ace an assessment!
