    <textOnly>So.. Apparently systems are like dictators..

Hell yeah we are! Lately I find myself holding a Cuban cigar and a glass of whisky like a true dictator does! I even got a white hamster to stroke because cats as evil partners are so last decade..

So you would be wise to not underestimate Carlos &quot;Ricky&quot; el Diablo (yes, of course its a viable name for a hamster!!) he knows kung-fu and is excellent at nibbling on ankles of my enemies.. muahahaha!

That&apos;s right, I even have an evil laugh! What? You don&apos;t think it&apos;s very original? Not creative enough? Well.. No one asked you!

Now you&apos;re thinking.. &quot;Damn, Maks has all of those cool dictatory stuff, but he doesnt have a secret hideout!&quot; and you are wrong! Mua-Ha-Ha-Haaa.. ( Im getting better at this)

Well, for your information I have a very secret base at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean at
N 39Â° 54&apos; 35.0504&quot;! It has a massive aquarium with nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine Goldfish swimming in circles! It&apos;s probably the most beautiful place on earth but you will never find it because its secret and I would never tell you where it was!
