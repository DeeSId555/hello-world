All About Interviews

Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the Step Forward newsletter. This time we take a close look at employer interviews and what they’re all about. We’re going to hear from people who have already done them and give you the inside scoop on how to make sure you get the job. Here we go!

“Be passionate about the organisation and let your enthusiasm and confidence shine through”
- Sophie Drechsler, Operations Officer and Exeutive Assistant to the CEO

Let The Step Forward Interviews Begin!

You’ve done the assessments, you’ve written your CV and now it’s time for the Step Forward interviews. This month, we had the first of our employer matching events and it was a big success with many young people being offered roles for September. We sat down with young people on the day and asked them a few questions so that you can know what to expect.

&apos;I went over my CV and job description. I planned almost everything I possibly could: travel plan, the organisations, practising CAR&apos;.
&apos;I did extensive research on the companies, e.g. read  their website&apos;.
&apos;I did mock interviews with my mum&apos;.
&apos;I prepared several questions to ask the employers at the end of the interview&apos;.

&apos;The company love when you show enthusiasm, so researching into them will go a long way&apos;.
&apos;Don’t assume the interviewer will be tough on you. They’re serious but friendly too&apos;!
&apos;Expect to be nervous, it’s normal and expect lots of questions, it’s an interview&apos;!

All excellent advice. You’ll hear from us in the next few months with an invitation to   interviews so until then, keep practising.

“Show a specific interest in the organisation. Try not to generalise”

A Success Story

We want to offer a huge congratulations to all our successful candidates at the first round of interviews! One of these is Mariam, who interviewed with the Business Services Association and is going to start her role as a Business Support Officer in September. We asked her what it was like on the day…

How did you find the day? I was nervous when I saw the other candidates and met the employer as this was my first interview.

How was the interview? It was surprisingly relaxed and the interviewer was really friendly. She asked about me a lot and it was more casual than I had prepared with my teacher.

How do you feel now? Really excited and happy to start!


Well done Mariam! And well done to everyone who aced their interview!

“Tell a compelling story and be specific about the outcomes of your examples”
- Melanie Maxwell-Scott, Director of Policy, Business Services Association
