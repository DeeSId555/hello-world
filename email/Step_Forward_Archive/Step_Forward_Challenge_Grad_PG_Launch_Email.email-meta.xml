From The Challenge: A great opportunity for your child

Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

Last year your child, {!Contact.FirstName}, completed our programme NCS with The Challenge. I am delighted to let you know that {!Contact.FirstName} is now eligible to apply to Step Forward.

In today’s economic climate it’s hard for young people to secure employment, whatever their qualifications and experience. Standing out from the crowd has never been more important. Step Forward is a unique opportunity which helps young people secure their future and get ahead.

Step Forward is a 12 month full-time professional programme for school leavers run by The Challenge across London. Whether they plan to go to university, straight into the world of work or are still making their decision, it gives young people the professional and personal skills required to succeed in their future career.  As a graduate of NCS with The Challenge, {!Contact.FirstName} has the exclusive option of applying to Step Forward before others even hear about it.

Young people who are accepted onto Step Forward will get paid to work for a prestigious high quality employer for the year, where they will gain valuable experience and training which will help make them more employable in the future. Over 12 months, {!Contact.FirstName} will learn new skills and meet new people in a professional work environment. Step Forward accelerates a young person’s career by giving them the qualities and the professional networks they need to thrive.

Each young person is paired with a mentor who will provide support throughout the year and give guidance on future education and career goals. In addition, {!Contact.FirstName} would have the chance to share these experiences with other young people on the programme.  Graduating after 12 months, young people complete Step Forward at the perfect time to fulfil their chosen goals, whether beginning their next job or starting university.

Not only is Step Forward free, but each young person will get paid £9,000 over the year.

If you don’t want your child to miss out on this opportunity please talk to them about Step Forward and complete your unique ‘Expression of Interest’ Here.


Best wishes,
