    <subject>From The Challenge: An exciting opportunity for your child</subject>
    <textOnly>The Challenge presents: Step Forward


Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

Last year your child, {!Contact.FirstName}, completed the NCS programme with The Challenge. I am delighted to let you know that {!Contact.FirstName} is now eligible to apply to Step Forward.

In today’s economic climate it’s hard for young people to secure employment, whatever their qualifications and experience. Standing out from the crowd has never been more important. Step Forward is a unique opportunity which helps young people secure their future and get ahead.

What is Step Forward?

Step Forward is a London based 12 month paid work placement for school or college leavers. Whether they plan to go to university, straight into the world of work or are still making their decision, it gives young people the professional and personal skills required to succeed in their future career.

Young people who are accepted onto Step Forward gain invaluable work experience with a top employer while training towards a nationally recognised level 3 qualification. Throughout the year they will benefit from the support of a trained mentor and extensive professional development training. The mentor and tutor will guide them through the year for all their pastoral, employee and academic needs as well as for the future.

Step Forward accelerates a young person&apos;s career by giving them the qualities as well as the professional and personal networks they need to thrive.

What next?

As a graduate of NCS with The Challenge, {!Contact.FirstName} has the exclusive option of applying to Step Forward before others even hear about it. As a competitive programme we encourage {!Contact.FirstName} to register their interest as soon as possible.

If you don’t want your child to miss out on this opportunity please talk to them about Step Forward and complete an expression of interest here.
