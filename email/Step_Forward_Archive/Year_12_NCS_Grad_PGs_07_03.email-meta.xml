    <textOnly>The Challenge Presents: Step Forward


Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

The school year is passing quickly and we wanted to make sure that {!Contact.FirstName} has everything planned for when they leave school / college. Step Forward, brought to you by The Challenge, gives your child everything they need to succeed in their future career.

{!Contact.FirstName} can apply now on our website to secure their future.

www.stepforward.uk.com


&quot;I love Step Forward because I get the scope to learn new skills which aids my personal growth and development&quot;
- Step Forward Associate


Remind me again, what is Step Forward?

Step Forward is a London based 12 month programme for school and college leavers. Whether they plan to go onto university after Step Forward, straight into the world of work or are still making their decision, we give young people the skills employers are looking for.

Young people who are accepted onto Step Forward gain:

Invaluable experience with quality employers
Comprehensive personal and professional development training
A nationally recognised qualification
The advice and support of a trained mentor
£9000 salary

And don&apos;t just take our word for it...

In the world of work, qualifications alone aren’t always enough to get someone their first job. Employers are increasingly looking for experience that goes above and beyond. Here’s what a partner at Hogan Lovells had to say about Step Forward:

“As an international law firm that recruits the most driven, talented and team-oriented people, we value highly the transferable and personal skills developed on programmes such as Step Forward: problem solving skills, leadership and teamwork”

We work with a broad range of companies and charities, big and small, including Bloomberg, New Look and vInspired. You can see a full list here.

If you work for a small or large organisation and would like to discuss having a 12 month apprentice, please give our account management team a call on 0203 793 7317 or email sf.employers@the-challenge.org.

What next for your child?

You can now secure your son / daughter’s future today by encouraging them to apply online now at:

www.stepforward.uk.com

They should login to our 10 minute application form using their email and NCS pin/password.

Leaving school this summer?

In order to be considered for our next assessment events on Saturday 12th and 19th March we must receive an application from your son / daughter by midnight on the Thursday before the event, so make sure they apply now.

Leaving school summer 2017?

Your son / daughter can stay one step ahead of the crowd and apply now to be invited to our assessments in October 2016. They can apply to Step Forward alongside any UCAS or other job applications and we encourage them to keep their options open.


Best wishes,

Step Forward
