3.45pm onwards                 Leave


What to bring:


If you have not submitted your presentation you should bring this with you on the day. If you have already submitted it then there is nothing you need to bring.



What next?


There are a few things you need to do to prepare for the day. Marriott will expect you to research their organisation before the interview.  They will also ask you questions about yourself. You can make sure that you are as prepared as possible by ensuring that you do the following:

Read the job description carefully
Research Marriott by looking at their website
Read the interview preparation document attached to this email
Read over your CV
Remember that Marriott staff will be observing candidates all day so even if you are not taking part in an activity you should be acting professionally at all times.


We look forward to seeing you there.


Step Forward.
