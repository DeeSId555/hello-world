In the meantime, we thought that we&apos;d let current Associates and employers tell you about Step Forward from their point of view. Enjoy!

A Step Forward Associate Tells All

What does a year on Step Forward really look like? We spoke to Emily our Associate at Thomson Reuters, a multinational company that works in over 100 countries. Here’s what she had to say...

Step Forward is...starting my working life by helping me to put my foot into the world of work.

The training. I take part in Step Forward training every Thursday. I have really enjoyed our 5 week project called ’Make your Mark-et’ which is a chance to work in a group, develop skills and gain some practical experience.  We are creating business plans and will be able to sell the product soon.


The Job. My responsibilities include sorting out new starters and leavers, recruitment and interviews. The best day in my job so far was when I had a conference call with one of our colleagues in America. I also got to be involved in the charity boat race at Canary Wharf after my first few weeks.


“The biggest surprise is feeling like you are really respected by the people you work with and that you are a crucial part of the team”
- Emily, Step Forward Associate

Behind The Scenes With Our Employers

The Step Forward programme wouldn’t be possible without young people but it also relies on our fantastic employers. We have Associates working in companies across London; from small (and perfectly formed) offices in Clapham to bustling offices in Old Street with a view over the city.

But what are the employers really like? We sat down with a few of them to pick their brains about the programme. Below is an extract and you can read lots more employer profiles on our blog.

“We are giving our Step Forward Associate an alternative viewpoint on what an office is”
- Stephen Walker, Drew London




The Job. Kimberley runs the Drew office like a well-oiled machine. She helps out with running the financial stuff, answers the telephone, sorts out deliveries and we are tasking her with a social media piece we’re doing.

The Future. Kimberley has had a taster of working in a media based office and we’re a small business so you get to see the whole process. Kimberley wants to stay in marketing and she has massive potential.

Our employers are pretty great.  They range from agencies like Drew to crowdfunding platforms; from charities to an innovative bikelight manufacturer who ships to over 45 countries. This gives you a flavour of the type of organisation you could be working with in September, so get an application in now.


What next?

We know that you&apos;re busy with exams but it&apos;s always important to keep your options open. Our application form takes just 10 minutes so take a break from revision and secure your future.

You can also like us on facebook and follow us on twitter to be kept up to date with the latest information.

Best of luck with your application, and we hope to see you at the Step Forward assessment.

Good luck!
