August

Hello and welcome once again to the Step Forward Newsletter. One of the great things about Step Forward is the fact that you are supported throughout the year and beyond by a Step Forward mentor. This issue, we will introduce you to 2 of our mentors who will talk about their year and what they’re looking forward to in September. We also have a must watch video from a current Associate talking about his experience so far.

“Step Forward is meeting amazing people who have similar aspirations to me”
- Maryam, Step Forward Associate

Meet the Mentors


Vicky Johnson

I became a mentor because… I ran the NCS summer programme for 3 summers and absolutely loved my job. I found that the aspect I enjoyed most was spending time with the young people, seeing them grow and develop and helping them overcome challenges and celebrating their successes with them.

My favourite part of the job is…the journey I go on with the Associates, through their challenges, through their successes and seeing how far they have all come.

The highlight of my year? Wow that&apos;s a hard one! There have been so many! The main highlight, I think, is watching your Associates grow as people. They have all come such a long way and it’s been amazing to be a part of that.

My number one tip for anyone about to start the programme is…get as much out of the programme as you can! There are endless opportunities and they are yours for the taking! Meet as many people as possible, reflect often, be open-minded and lastly...enjoy it!

“The qualification gives me the knowledge and skills that I need to take forward in my future success”
- Robyn, Step Forward Associate

I became a mentor because…it&apos;s all about building connections with young people, supporting them when they need it, pushing them to achieve.

My favourite part about the job is…getting to know the people on the programme.  I&apos;m genuinely amazed by the work and even more by the potential of the Associates, and it&apos;s hard not to feel proud sometimes.

There&apos;s been no one highlight of the year as there&apos;s so many things that have brought a smile to my face.  Whether it was associates changing their life&apos;s path, overcoming major hurdles or achieving brilliant things, I&apos;ve enjoyed so much.

My number one tip for anyone about to start the programme is…to keep an open mind.  Sometimes help or inspiration come from unlikely sources, and it&apos;s only by being open to it that it can help us along in life - whether it&apos;s from someone apparently different to you from your STEP team or a colleague you didn&apos;t get along with at first.


&quot;I&apos;m not known as an apprentice, I&apos;m known as someone who is an expert at what she does”
- Temi, Step Forward Associate


What about the Associates?

But it’s not all about the mentors. Step Forward doesn’t work without the motivated young people who take part. Last year’s Associates are nearing the end of their time with us and this means it’s time to reflect on the year and what they’ve learnt. Ashley, who works at The Brilliant Club, shared his thoughts. Enjoy!

What next?

As you know, Step Forward interviews are still happening and we’re working hard to match you with the right employer. While we do that you should reflect on the feedback you’ve received from your previous interview(s) to make sure you secure yourself a great job.
