<p>So.. Apparently systems are like dictators..</p>

<p>Hell yeah we are! Lately I find myself holding a Cuban cigar and a glass of whisky like a true dictator does! I even got a white hamster to stroke because cats as evil partners are so last decade..</p>

<p>So you would be wise to not underestimate Carlos &quot;Ricky&quot; el Diablo (yes, of course its a viable name for a hamster!!) he knows kung-fu and is excellent at nibbling on ankles of my enemies.. muahahaha!</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, I even have an evil laugh! What? You don&#39;t think it&#39;s very original? Not creative enough? Well.. No one asked you!</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re thinking.. &quot;Damn, Maks has all of those cool dictatory stuff, but he doesnt have a secret hideout!&quot; and you are wrong! Mua-Ha-Ha-Haaa.. ( Im getting better at this)</p>

<p>Well, for your information I have a very secret base at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean at&nbsp;<br />
N 39&deg; 54&#39; 35.0504&quot;! It has a massive aquarium with nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine Goldfish swimming in circles! It&#39;s probably the most beautiful place on earth but you will never find it because its secret and I would never tell you where it was!</p>
