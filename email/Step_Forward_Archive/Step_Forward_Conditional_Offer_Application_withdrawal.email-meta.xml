    <textOnly>Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},

We have sent you three emails and tried to call a number of times to remind you to submit your documents.   As these documents are necessary to fulfil your conditional offer for Step Forward, we regret to inform you that we must now withdraw your application.

We wish you every success in the future.

Kind regards,


Step Forward
