Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The UCAS deadline is fast approaching and we wanted to make sure that you don’t miss out on Step Forward. In the world of work, qualifications alone aren’t always enough to get you your first job. Step Forward will help you get ahead whether you plan to go onto uni after a year with us, straight into the world of work or if you’re just not sure.

Take the next step and make sure you apply today to be considered for our next assessment event!

Remind me again, what is Step Forward?

Step Forward is a London based 12 month programme for school and college leavers. People who graduate from Step Forward will gain:

Invaluable experience with quality employers
Comprehensive personal and professional development training
A nationally recognised qualification
The advice and support of a trained mentor
£9000 salary

And don&apos;t just take our word for it...

We aim to create the most employable 19 year olds in the country. This requires a close group of motivated young people but it also relies on our amazing employers. Here are a few things our employers had to say about Step Forward.

“Young, high calibre candidates are hard to find”
- Joseph Sandi, THET
“Step Forward develops the skills that it&apos;s only possible to grow in the workplace”
- Phillip Ellis, Blaze
“[Step Forward] is a huge experience that I would have
loved to have had”
- Thomas Davies, Seedrs
