Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},

It&apos;s normal to feel nervous when you have an interview because you want to do your best. If you prepare and practise you can get the better of your nerves and give yourself the best chance of getting the job. Read our guides to see how you can improve your performance.



Know your CV inside out

Your CV will most certainly be referred to on the day and employers will likely ask you questions about what’s on there. You can prepare for these questions by knowing your CV inside out!

Additionally, the employer may not remember what’s on your CV so don’t assume they can remember. Use this opportunity to remind them of all your great experiences.

Make sure you can actually talk about your experiences in depth i.e. what you learnt, skills you developed, what you found most challenging.

Played for a sports team and showed resilience? Volunteered for a charity or worked in a fast paced environment? These are just some examples of the experiences you could expand on.

Suggestion: You could bring a copy of your CV on the day and read through it while you wait to go in.


Be prepared

The job description will tell you about the job each company has to offer. It’s your job to read it carefully and be able to tell the employer at the interview why you want that job, what excites you about it and why you are the perfect candidate for them!

You should also be prepared for questions like “Why did you choose Step Forward” and/or “Why did you choose this particular pathway? “

Think back to why you actually chose Step Forward over other options and what it was that appealed to you about the programme.

Remember to remain professional at all times.



Researching the Company

You will receive the Job Description a few weeks before your interview.

In this time, research the company and find out what they do.  Start with the company website.  This is usually the best resource.

Note down the company mission, vision and values statements. This tells you about the company culture. Use this information to highlight why you are a good fit in your job interview.

It is important to show the company you have done your research. Asking questions or commenting on something you read about them at the end is a really good way to do this.



Remember!

Context, Action, Result

This is your secret weapon for the interviews! When asked about what experience or skills you can bring to the role, CAR will help you structure your answers. Remember, it’s what you did, not your team. Use ‘I’ instead of ‘we’.

You might be asked: “What is your proudest achievement?”

The context could be “At school, our year group needed to raise money for the school prom.” What you actioned was “As head of the fundraising committee, I led the team in setting up and holding a talent show”. And as a result “We ended up raising £500 which allowed our school prom to go ahead.”



Last but not least...Practice!

We cannot stress the importance of this enough!
Do this with family and friends and if they’re not around...use a mirror!


Good luck!
