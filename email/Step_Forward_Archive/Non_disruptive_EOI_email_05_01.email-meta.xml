Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The UCAS deadline is fast approaching and we wanted to make sure that you don’t miss out on Step Forward. Our 12 month paid work placement will help you get ahead whether you plan to go onto uni after a year with us, straight into the world of work or if you’re just not sure.

Take the next step and make sure you apply today to be considered for our next assessment event!

“There is another path - the school leaver path - that is just as beneficial, just as developed, just as qualified as university”
- Shereez Dharsey, Future Foundations


Remind me again, what is Step Forward?

Step Forward is a London based 12 month programme for school and college leavers. People who graduate from Step Forward will gain:

Invaluable experience with quality employers
Comprehensive personal and professional development training
A nationally recognised qualification
The advice and support of a trained mentor
£9000 salary



And don&apos;t just take our word for it...

Roisin is an Associate on our Early Years Education pathway and also one of our resident bloggers. She shared her journey to the Step Forward programme.

“After perhaps the 20th pros and cons list, I decided that Step Forward would be the best option for me. Three months into the programme and I know I made the right decision, even though I still want to explore other careers after university. Step Forward is a brilliant option for all types of people, especially for those who have no real idea about what to do after school. Bring on the rest of the year!”
