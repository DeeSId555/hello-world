    <textOnly>Your CV and Character Survey


Dear {!Step_Forward_Activity__c.Associate__c},


Hello from Step Forward.  Congratulations again on your conditional offer to be on Step Forward in September.  Step Forward is a competitive programme – we have received around 5,000 expressions of interest for a limited number of places this year – so only the best applicants have got this far.  Well done!


There is an information evening coming up soon which you have been invited to.  After that, the next step in the process is to start arranging interviews for you with employers.  In late spring we will invite you to an interview matching day where you will meet three potential employers.


We want you to really impress these employers.  To do this we need you to tell us a bit more about you.

1) Character survey

This should take no more than 5 minutes and needs to be completed by Sunday 22nd February. Click here to complete the survey.

2) Your CV

This will take a few days to plan and the final version should be completed by Sunday 1st March.


Important Information about writing your CV

A CV is important as it is the first impression an employer will get before they meet you.  The CV you write for Step Forward will be useful throughout your career, so this is something you can save and build on for your future.  Make sure you are honest in your CV as an Employer may ask you questions about it during interviews.

Attached to this email is &apos;Your Step Forward CV&apos;.  You must use this document as a template to write your personal CV.  You must save a final copy of your CV as a Word document, then upload and send it to us by clicking here.
Your final CV must fit onto one page of A4 only.  The font should be &apos;Calibri&apos; in size 11.  Spell check does not work in the template.  You should type your CV on a separate Word document first, check the spelling and grammar, then copy and paste into the template.

Attached is guidance on ‘How to write your Step Forward CV’ with advice and examples of how to write a great CV to impress an Employer.
We can’t put you forward for interviews unless you have sent us your CV so it’s important you complete this by Sunday 1st March.

If you have any questions about how to complete these, do give us a ring – we are here to help!  You can contact us on 0203 542 2400.
