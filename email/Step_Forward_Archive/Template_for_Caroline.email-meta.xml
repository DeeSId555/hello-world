    <textOnly>Dear {!Step_Forward_School_Activity__c.StepFwd_CT_first_name__c},

As exam season comes to a close we know that you&apos;ll be keen to guide your students towards their best possible future.  If you have Year 12 and 13 students in mind that are keen to launch a career then Step Forward could be what they are looking for.

Step Forward is a unique apprenticeship scheme for school leavers aged 17-18. Young people will be able to gain hands on work experience, a Level 3 professional qualification and the opportunity to mix with peers from a variety of backgrounds, whilst working on social action projects.

This combination will not only prepare them for the world of work but build the confidence and social skills needed to succeed whatever they do next.

Key facts about the Step Forward scheme:

Free of charge if started before turning 19
