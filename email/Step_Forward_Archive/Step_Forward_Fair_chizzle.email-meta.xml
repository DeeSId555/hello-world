Thanks for registering your interest in Step Forward!

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

It’s been a few months since we came in to Ealing Higher Educational Fair and you expressed an interest in our school leavers’ programme, Step Forward.  We imagine a lot has changed for you since then, and things are unlikely to slow down over the next year.

There are a lot of things to consider about your future. In today’s competitive job market, it’s more important than ever to start your career journey right.

To remind you

Step Forward is a full-time 12-month programme that helps you launch your career, ready yourself for the future and gives you the time to make decisions about what you want to do next. Get paid to do real work for a high quality employer, make new friends and develop the skills you’ll need to get ahead in life.

What’s new?

When we last saw you, at the Educational Fair, we had 3 Pathways on offer.  We now have a total of 5 Pathways, giving you an even wider choice of career paths that can help to shape your future.  You can now choose between Accounting, Business Support Services, Working with Children, Social Media and Digital Marketing  and IT, Software and Web Development.


Who’s it for?

Step Forward is for ambitious and dedicated 17-18 year olds.  Regardless of what you want to go on and do, whether it’s University, a Gap Year, the independence of the world of work or you simply want to keep your options open, Step Forward can help you do that better!

Want to be sure that you’re beginning your career in the best possible way?

It’s could be easy  to start following a career path that isn’t all you expected it would be.  Step Forward allows you to spend a year trying something new, whilst gaining valuable transferable skills for any future career.

What now?


We are pleased to announce that applications for 2015 have now opened!

This is your chance to get the experience you need to thrive in the world of work.  Not only that, but you get the chance to expand your networks with other young people and employers, making lasting friendships and getting to know people who could give you a foot up later in life.


Step Forward is a competitive programme and places are limited so avoid missing out on this opportunity by applying as soon as possible. Apply online at www.stepforward.uk.com before 12th October to be considered for our next assessment event in October half term.

Best of luck with your application, and we hope to see you at the Step Forward assessment!
