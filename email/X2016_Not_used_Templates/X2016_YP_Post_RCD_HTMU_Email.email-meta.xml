Hours to make up for NCS
 
Hi {!Contact.Name}, 

You’re on your way to becoming an NCS graduate! However, as you missed some of NCS, you need to do some volunteering so you can graduate. 

How much volunteering do I need to do?
You’ve missed {!Attendance__c.Hours_for_100__c} hours - we encourage you to make up for all of these so you get the best out of it.
But, to be able to graduate from NCS, you only need to make up {!Attendance__c.Hours_required_for_graduation_form__c} hours.
If you miss any more of NCS, you may need to make up more hours or you may not be able to graduate if you miss too much.

What kind of volunteering?
You and your parent or guardian will need to organise your volunteering. Click here to see the types of volunteering that count: http://questions.ncsthechallenge.org/

When’s the deadline?
Midday on &quot;date&quot; if you want to get your certificate at graduation (your graduation invite will arrive soon, if it hasn’t already).
1 November is the final deadline - if you volunteer by this date, you will get your certificate in the post.
You will need to tell us when you have done your volunteering - click here to see how to do this: http://questions.ncsthechallenge.org/

What if I feel I can’t volunteer on my own?
Just let us know by calling 0203 542 2400 or emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org. Together we’ll agree a plan. 

So what are you waiting for? Get out there, volunteer and move one step closer to becoming an official graduate of NCS. 

Kind regards, 

Josie Whitworth
Head of Programmes and Staffing
