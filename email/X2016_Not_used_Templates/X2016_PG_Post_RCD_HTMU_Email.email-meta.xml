{!Contact.FirstName} has hours to make up for NCS

Dear Parent or Guardian of  {!Contact.Name},

{!Contact.FirstName} is on their way to becoming an NCS graduate! However, as they missed some of NCS, they need to do some volunteering so they can graduate. 

How much volunteering does {!Contact.FirstName} need to do?

{!Contact.FirstName} has missed {!Attendance__c.Hours_for_100__c} hours - we encourage them to make up for all of these so they really get the best out of it.
But, to be able to graduate from NCS, {!Contact.FirstName} only needs to make up {!Attendance__c.Hours_required_for_graduation_form__c} hours.
If they miss any more of NCS, they may need to make up more hours or they may not be able to graduate if they miss too much.

What kind of volunteering?
You and {!Contact.FirstName} will need to organise their volunteering. Click here to see the types of volunteering that count: http://questions.ncsthechallenge.org/

When is the deadline?
Midday on &quot;&quot; if {!Contact.FirstName} wants to get their certificate at graduation (your graduation invite will arrive soon, if it hasn’t already).
1 November is the final deadline - if {!Contact.FirstName} volunteers by this date, they will receive their certificate in the post.
You will need to tell us when {!Contact.FirstName} has done their volunteering - click here to see how to do this: http://questions.ncsthechallenge.org/ 

What if I feel {!Contact.FirstName} can’t volunteer on their own?
Just let us know by calling 0203 542 2400 or emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org. Together we’ll agree a plan. 

We hope this information helps {!Contact.FirstName} move one step closer to becoming an official graduate of NCS - with a certificate signed by the Prime Minister! 

Kind regards,
