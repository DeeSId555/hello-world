NCS - attendance update

Hi {!Contact.Name} 

We hope you’re having a great time on NCS!

We wanted to let you know that, based on our records of your attendance, you have missed too much of the programme to become an official NCS graduate. Unfortunately, this means you won’t be able to receive a certificate at the graduation ceremony. 

However, we hope you will continue to join us for the rest of NCS so you can get the best out of the experience. 

You are still very welcome to come along to the graduation ceremony with a guest on {!Wave_Selection__c.Graduation_Date__c} to celebrate your achievements. You will receive an invite with full details soon, if you haven’t already. 

If you have any questions or need to get in touch with us about this, please contact us using the details below. 

We hope to see you during the rest of NCS! 

Kind regards, 

Josie Whitworth
Head of Programmes and Staffing
