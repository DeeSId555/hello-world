    <subject>URGENT! Availability for Short Notice IF Required for The Challenge</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you are all well, and excited that the summer programme is upon us!! Some of you have waves, and some of you are still waiting. I am working through the last few waves as fast as possible, and will be in contact with everyone without a current placement by next Friday, at the latest.

As we are now into the summer programme I need to keep the list of people available at short notice up to date on a regular basis, for those &quot;just in case&quot; moments that come up in the Challenge. These will be for if a YP is identified as needing support that we were not aware of before, or if there is an emergency situation with the assigned SW which means they need to leave the placement.

So, I am looking to see if you would be available to cover at short notice if required for wave 3-12? I will update this occasionally with these reminder emails, but please stay in touch with me if you are available for this type of work.

This may not occur, but I am compiling a list of people who could do this should this be needed. And I have needed to use this on one occasion so far, so it&apos;s not impossible!

It may be for a few days or for the entire wave. It would be down to your availability to help at short notice and for the cover needed.

I do not foresee a need for this often, but it&apos;s better to be prepared for the possibility!

Please let me know IF you are available for this wave at short notice and which waves these are. IF you are not available for this type of support, please do not respond to this email.

As always if you have any questions, or need to discuss any aspect of your role/ availability/ allocations please contact me, and I will be responding as soon as possible to all inquires.

I will be in contact soon.

Warm Regards,
