Take on The Challenge this summer


Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for your interest in The Challenge. Here, we will give you more information about The Challenge, the largest provider of National Citizen Service places, and tell you how you can complete an application to secure a place.

The Challenge is a part-residential programme designed exclusively for 15-17 year olds. It begins with three challenges over 14 days (with breaks in between) during the summer holidays, followed by four weekend days in early autumn. Throughout the programme, you will build self-confidence as well as skills in leadership, teamwork and communication. As the largest provider of NCS places, employers and universities recognise the unique value of The Challenge in your development.

On The Challenge you get the opportunity to try various outdoor activities in specialised centres, spend time at university learning a new skill of your choice with the help of qualified professionals in your chosen field, and finally get the chance to develop your own project to make an impact on your local area. Thousands of other young people across the country have taken part over the past four years, sharing an exciting and memorable experience and developing lasting friendships

A place on The Challenge is worth £1500, but thanks to government support, we are able to offer you an all-inclusive price of just £50. This covers all accommodation, food, transport, and equipment. If the cost is an issue for you, you can request a bursary when you apply.

While we offer a wide range of start dates, there are a limited number of places available on each date. The quickest and easiest way to confirm a place is through our website. Please visit www.the-challenge.org, and sign in using your personal log in details:

CHALLENGE ID: {!Account.TCNAccountID__c}
LOGIN PIN: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

There will be a short break between each part of the programme. The specific dates for each part of the programme relevant to each start date are detailed on our website: www.the-challenge.org.

For more information, as well as feedback from last year’s participants and their parents, visit our website. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us on 0207 921 4404 or contact@the-challenge.org.

Yours sincerely,

Rebecca Carter
