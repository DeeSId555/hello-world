Details of our Focus Group


Dear {!Contact.Name},

Congratulations on booking your space on NCS (National Citizen Service) this summer!

As the leading national provider of NCS, The Challenge would like to invite you to take part in a small discussion group to find out what has inspired young people, just like yourself, into signing up to NCS so far.

The focus group will provide an opportunity for you to have your voice heard. We want to know about your personal experience with NCS so far; we want to find out what we’re doing well and what we need to improve on so we can engage and inspire 1000’s of other young people across the country to join in on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

The focus group will be taking place at our national headquarters in Waterloo on Wednesday 30th March and will last approx 2 hours. More information will be sent to those confirming their attendance prior to the session.

We really hope you take this opportunity to share your views as they will help to influence a charity’s national engagement strategy and subsequently make a real difference to young people’s lives.

To reward you for your time and effort  we will be giving you a £20 shopping voucher, paying for your travel expenses and will also provide light snacks and refreshments.

If you would like to take part in the focus group on 30/03/16, please RSVP to Aziz
