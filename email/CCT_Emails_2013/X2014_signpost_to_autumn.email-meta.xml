Say YES to our half-term NCS programme


Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for remaining on the waiting list for NCS with The Challenge - NCS has been really popular this year. As you haven’t yet got a place this summer, we wanted to tell you early on about an exclusive opportunity to sign up for our October half-term NCS programme.

This exciting, part-residential programme runs during October half-term1 and over four weekend days in November (8, 9, 15 and 22 November).

It’s a chance for 16-17 year olds2, usually in year 12, to develop skills which look great on your CV or UCAS application – and to make friends and have fun along the way.

For a taster of what NCS is like, take a look at this video that a participant called Shannon posted about Part 1 of the programme.

What’s more, if you have made a payment for the summer programme, you can use this for the October programme instead. If you haven’t paid yet, you can pay (a maximum of £50) when logging in to your online account, or request financial support to help with this.

Don’t miss out on this last chance to take part in NCS with The Challenge in 2014. Simply:

1. Log back in to your online account here - parents/guardians will need to do this.
2.	Go to the choose dates section and click show dates.
3. Change your current date selection to the 25 October programme (and add any other summer programmes you may still be available for).

Sign up soon while places are still available for this experience of a lifetime!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter - Director at The Challenge
