NCS with The Challenge is a fun and action packed part-residential programme designed exclusively for 15-17 year olds. On the programme, you will build self-confidence as well as skills in leadership, teamwork and communication. Employers and universities also recognise the unique value of the programme, helping you to stand out in the future.

While we offer a wide range of start dates, there are a limited number of places available on each date. The quickest and easiest way to confirm a place is through our website. Please visit NCSTheChallenge.org for more information about the programme and to sign up today!

If you have any further questions, please visit our online FAQs. Alternatively you can email us at contact@the-challenge.org.
