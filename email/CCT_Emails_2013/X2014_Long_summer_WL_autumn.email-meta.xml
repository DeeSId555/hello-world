Improve your chances of getting a place on NCS 2014


Dear {!Contact.Name} and Parent/Guardian,

Thank you for remaining on the waiting list for NCS with The Challenge - NCS has been really popular this year. As you haven’t got a place so far this summer, please check you have selected all programme dates you are available for. We still have spaces on some programmes.

For a taster of what NCS is like, take a look at this video that Shannon posted about her experience of Part 1 of the programme1. You can also visit Facebook / Twitter to see what people doing the programme are saying!

If you make sure you have selected all the programmes you can attend, you will give yourself the best chance of being able to develop skills and new make friends with NCS in 2014.

Our exciting October half-term NCS programme is the perfect opportunity for 16-17 year olds2, usually in year 12, to develop skills which look great on your CV or UCAS application – and to make friends and have fun along the way. This part-residential programme runs during October half-term3 and over four weekend days in November (8, 9, 15 and 22 November). If you made a payment for the summer programme, you can use this for the October programme.

Don’t miss out on your last chance to take part in NCS with The Challenge in 2014. Simply:

1. Log back in to your online account here - parents/guardians will need to do this.
2. Go to the choose dates section and click show dates.
3. Click Change your current date selection and select all the extra programme dates you are available for. Do not click on the dates you have selected previously, as this will remove you from those waiting lists.
4. Click continue.

Act now while places are still available for this experience of a lifetime!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter - Director at The Challenge
