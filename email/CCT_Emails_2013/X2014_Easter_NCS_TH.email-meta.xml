We would like to invite you, your family and friends to join us at our exclusive Tower Hamlets event on Saturday 26th April at the John Scurr Community Centre, 1A Bekesbourne St, London, E14 7JQ.

The event will run from 2.00pm - 4.00pm and is a great chance for you to find out more information about the programme, including options if you will be observing to Ramadan and all-female programmes. There will also be the opportunity for you to meet other young people who will be going on the programme this summer.

Translators will be available on the day and light refreshments will be provided. Please confirm your attendance by emailing laura.rowland@the-challenge.org or by calling Laura on 07908945109.
