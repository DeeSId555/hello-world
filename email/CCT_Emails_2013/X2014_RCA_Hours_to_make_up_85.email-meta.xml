NCS – you have hours to make up before you can graduate


Dear {!Contact.Name} and Parent/Guardian,

Now that you have participated in all parts of NCS with The Challenge, your thoughts are probably turning to graduation.

You missed part of the programme but don&apos;t worry, you can still complete the programme and graduate - all you need to do is make up hours through volunteering.

Based on your attendance, you need to complete {!Attendance__c.Hours_required_for_graduation_form__c} hours of volunteering.

If you make up your hours, you will receive a certificate signed by the Prime Minister to reflect your achievement and show you have completed NCS with The Challenge.

The deadline for telling us about the hours you have made up in time for your graduation ceremony is midday on the Friday before your graduation.

Your graduation ceremony will be on {!Attendance__c.Graduation_date__c}. We have sent more details about your graduation ceremony by post - please contact us if you have not received this.

You can still make up your hours after your graduation date, but will receive your certificate in the post rather than at the graduation ceremony.


How do I complete my hours of volunteering?
You and your parent/guardian will need to organise your own volunteering. You could make up your hours at a charity or organisation such as the ones you have got to know over the summer. Ask your friends or family members in case they know of any local charities or organisations that would be suitable.

It can be any activity that involves spending time doing something that aims to benefit the environment or community. Please note that you cannot get paid for it and it cannot be just helping relatives or friends. Other than that, you get to decide!

Examples of activities that can be used:
•	Leading sessions at a local youth group or uniformed group such as guides or scouts.
•	Giving time to a local community member, group or charity, e.g. volunteering at local charity shop or in the office of a local charity, acting as a marshal at a charity fun run.
•	Running an after school sports club for younger pupils.

Examples of activities that cannot be used:
•	Giving time to a profit making organisation.
•	Paid work for a local charity or community group, e.g. being paid to distribute leaflets promoting a charity.
•	Helping relatives or friends, e.g. cooking a relative dinner.

How do I tell you when I have completed my volunteering?
You need to log in to The Challenge Society website, using the TCS login card you were given during the programme (or the ‘forgot your details’ option on the website). Then click on Log my hours and add your own volunteering task to enter your volunteering details. Please note that we cannot log your volunteering hours over the phone.

We will then process the information you submit. This may involve verifying that you have completed the hours by getting in touch with the volunteering contact you have provided.

What if I don&apos;t make up my hours?
You will still be invited to attend the graduation ceremony alongside your teammates; however, you will not be able to receive your graduation certificate.

More questions?
You can email us at contact@the-challenge.org, or call us on 020 3542 2400.

Please note that if you reply to this email directly it will not be responded to - please use the contact details above for any enquiries.

Yours sincerely,

Rachel Slade - Head of Programmes
