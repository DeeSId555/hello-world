For your action

Dear {!Contact.FirstName} and Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName},

Our records show that we have not yet received all the information we need to confirm {!Contact.FirstName}’s place on The Challenge this summer. We had reserved a place for {!Contact.FirstName}, but due to high demand for places on The Challenge we have temporarily placed {!Contact.FirstName} on a waiting list until we receive the information we require.

All we need in order to finish processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s place is:

{!Contact.CAL_Missing_Items_Criteria_Paragraph__c}
Call us: 020 7921 4404 / Email us: contact@the-challenge.org /
Log into our website at: www.the-challenge.org

Once we have received this, we will be able to continue processing the application and will contact you if we need any further information. If you have any questions, please do get in touch with us so that we can assist you. Once the application process is complete, we will do our very best to ensure we can confirm {!Contact.FirstName}’s place as soon as possible and in the event that {!Contact.FirstName} remains on a waiting list we will let you know as soon as a place becomes available.

As places are filling up very rapidly across the country, we would urge {!Contact.FirstName} to remind friends to take part in this exciting and unique opportunity.

Yours sincerely,


Rebecca Carter
