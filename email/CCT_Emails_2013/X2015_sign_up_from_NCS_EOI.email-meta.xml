Your NCS application - next steps



Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


Thanks for starting your application for National Citizen Service (NCS)! We are The Challenge and we&apos;ll be running NCS in your area this summer. Here&apos;s a reminder of what NCS is about...

Completing your NCS application
You&apos;ve already made a start on your application, but there are still some more parts to be done.  Go to www.NCSTheChallenge.org, click ‘login’ and use your unique login details shown below to fill in some more details for your application:

Your NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Your young person password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

Your parent or guardian will need to fill in the main part of your application. Please ask your parent or guardian to do this. If you’re not sure who can complete your application form, please get in touch with us and we’ll have a chat (our contact details are at the end of this email).

It is quicker to apply online but if your parent or guardian would like a paper application form, they can call us on 0203 542 2400 and we’ll send one to them in the post.

Even though you expressed a preference to take part at a certain time, all our dates are subject to availability - so please ask your parent or guardian to complete your application and select your dates as soon as possible!

Any questions?
If you have any questions, take a look at questions.ncsthechallenge.org, or get in touch by emailing   contact@ncsthechallenge.org or calling 0203 542 2400.

Places are filling up fast so make sure you don&apos;t miss out! We&apos;ll be in touch once we&apos;ve received your application.

Yours sincerely,

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services
The Challenge (largest provider of NCS)

*Our programme dates are within the half-term holidays of most schools in the areas we work in (plus some additional weekend days).
