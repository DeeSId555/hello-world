Say YES to NCS this October half-term




Dear {!Contact.Name}

Thank you for expressing an interest in The NCS autumn programme with The Challenge.

We&apos;ve noticed that the date of birth provided to us is outside of the eligible age range for taking part in NCS with The Challenge. Young people generally need to have been aged 16 or 17 on 31 August 2014 and must be under 18 throughout the residential part of the programme.

We are sometimes able to offer spaces to young people outside of our normal age range, but only in exceptional circumstances. If you think the young person might still be eligible, or provided an incorrect date of birth, please sign up and we will contact you if there are any issues. If you are unsure about eligibility for NCS with The Challenge, please call us on 0203 542 2400 and we can discuss this with you.

The NCS with The Challenge autumn programme is an exciting, part-residential programme for 16-17 year olds*. It&apos;s the perfect opportunity to develop skills which look great on your CV or UCAS application, to make friends and have fun along the way. It runs over October half-term (25-31 October) and four weekend days in November. The programme structure is:

Part 1 - residential (4 days, 3 nights): 25 – 28 October
Part 2 – non-residential (3 days): 29 – 31 October
Part 3 – non-residential weekend days (4 days, not all consecutive): Saturday 8 November, Sunday 9 November, Saturday 15 November, Saturday 22 November.

Don&apos;t miss out on this chance to take part in NCS with The Challenge. It&apos;s quick and easy to sign up online, and online applications receive a £5 discount. Parents/guardians should follow this link to complete your application and select the programme starting on 25 October. You can use the login details you already have, or recover them here.

Each place is valued at over £1000 but government backing means the only cost you&apos;ll pay is a £50 administration fee. Accommodation, food, transport and equipment used during the programme is all covered. If you need some help with this cost you can request financial support when signing up.

More questions? Take a look at our Questions page, or get in touch at contact@the-challenge.org or on 0203 542 2400.

Make sure you don&apos;t miss out on the experience of a lifetime this half-term!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge
