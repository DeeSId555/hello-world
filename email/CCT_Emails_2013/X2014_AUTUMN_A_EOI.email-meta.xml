Applications for our
autumn programme
are now open!



Dear {!Contact.Name} and Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for expressing an interest in The NCS autumn programme with The Challenge. We wanted to let you know that applications for our autumn programme are now open.

The NCS autumn programme with The Challenge is an exciting, part-residential 7 day programme for 16 and 17 year olds* during  half term -  25-31 October - followed by 4 social action weekend days. The programme has 3 parts that will give all participants the chance to Get Active, Get involved and Make Their Mark in their community and gain valuable leadership, team-building and communication skills for the future.

The quickest and easiest way to sign up is online, where you will receive a £5 discount. Parents/guardians should follow this link to complete an application and select the programme starting on 25 October. If you started to sign up earlier this year, you can use the login details you already have, or recover them here. Alternatively, you can sign up as a new user.

We believe that all 16-17 year olds* deserve to take part in NCS. Each place is valued at over £1000 but government backing ensures that the full programme costs you no more than a £50 administration fee. This includes all accommodation, food, transport and equipment used during the programme. Financial support can also be requested when signing up if you need extra help with the cost.

Over 65,000 young people have already taken part in NCS and we’re still growing – so don’t let {!Contact.FirstName} miss out!

More questions? Take a look at our Questions page, or get in touch with us at contact@the-challenge.org or on 0203 542 2400.

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge
