    <subject>Your next challenge: International Citizen Service</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Challenge yourself to change your world. It’s time to use the skills you built during National Citizen Service with The Challenge to make a difference to the lives of young people around the world. You will go on a 10-12 week placement overseas, work side-by-side with local volunteers in developing countries and make a meaningful contribution to fighting poverty. You don’t need cash, experience or qualifications – just the ambition to make a difference.

This project is International Citizen Service (ICS) and it is demanding but hugely rewarding.  You will learn unique skills, which will help you play a part in tackling some of the world’s biggest issues and act as a great stepping-stone towards future job opportunities.

ICS is a UK government-funded overseas volunteering programme that brings together young people from all backgrounds to make a positive impact in communities overseas and in the UK.

On ICS you can apply for projects in one of 24 countries across Africa, Asia and Central America. ICS is open to all young people aged 18 – 25, but if you are younger, we encourage you to register now, and get your place on future projects It will be a life changing challenge but you will be able to make a massive difference to people’s lives around the globe.
