Reminder from NCS: social action days in September


Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Don&apos;t forget that {!Contact.FirstName} needs to attend their NCS social action days. Their team will meet on one of the weekend days throughout September - please check your timetable to see which days if you&apos;re not sure.

The day before each social action day, we will send {!Contact.FirstName} a text telling them the confirmed details of where they need to meet. Do look out for this as it will contain up-to-date information (some venues may have changed from those originally on your timetable).

Remember, if {!Contact.FirstName} doesn&apos;t attend all their social action days then they may not be able to graduate and receive their certificate, signed by the Prime Minister.

If you have any questions, please call us on 0203 542 2400.

We hope to see {!Contact.FirstName} at their social action day this weekend!

Yours sincerely,
Jo Lunt
Customer Services Manager
