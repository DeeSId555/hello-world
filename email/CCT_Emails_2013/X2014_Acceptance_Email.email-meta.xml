Congratulations!


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName},


Congratulations – you have completed {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for NCS with The Challenge this summer! {!Contact.FirstName} now has a confirmed place, starting on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c}.

{!Wave_Selection__c.Girl_only_wave_prog_email_sentence__c} The dates {!Contact.FirstName} will be on the programme are:
Part 1 (residential): {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} until {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_Return_Day__c}

Part 2 (residential): {!Wave_Selection__c.TC_KO_Day__c} until {!Wave_Selection__c.TC_End_Day__c}

Social action days (non-residential - young people travel to and from a local venue):  6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27, 28 September
Young people will be scheduled to attend four social action days in September, usually one day on each weekend. Please keep the above dates free for now. Exact dates will be sent out at least one month before the programme start date.

If any of these specific dates are a problem for you, or {!Contact.FirstName} is unable to attend the programme at all this summer, please contact us as soon as possible.

More information about the programme:
We’ll send you a detailed information pack for {!Contact.FirstName}’s programme approximately one month before the start date. This will include meeting point locations, times, and further essential information.

We will also email you an invitation to an information evening taking place approximately one to two weeks before {!Contact.FirstName} begins NCS with The Challenge. Here you will have the chance to meet us and ask any questions you may have.

In the meantime, please take a look at some information here, and visit www.NCSthechallenge.org/ to find the answers to any questions you may have. To stay connected, you can also check out Facebook.com/ NCSTheChallenge and follow us on Twitter @NCSTheChallenge.

It’s great that you’ve managed to secure {!Contact.FirstName} a space and we hope they are excited about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get ahead and make new friends.


Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter - Director at The Challenge
