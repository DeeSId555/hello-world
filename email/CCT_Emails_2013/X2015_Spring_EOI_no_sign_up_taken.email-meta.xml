Completing your NCS application



Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for letting us know you&apos;re interested in National Citizen Service (NCS). We are The Challenge and we&apos;ll be running NCS in your area in 2016. Need a reminder of what NCS is about? Check out this video...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a591P6wYiGU


NCS is a life-changing experience. It’s an opportunity to try new activities, make new friends and build the skills and confidence to help you in your future. Over 130,000 young people have already taken part - don&apos;t miss your chance! For more details, check out  NCSTheChallenge.org

When is NCS running in 2016?
In 2016, The Challenge will be running NCS on lots of different dates throughout the summer holidays. But, if you’re busy all summer, we also have a programme running during October half-term*, with some weekend days after. So you should be able to find a programme that fits in with your plans.

You&apos;ll need to be the right age to take part - you can check our age eligibility requirements at www.NCSTheChallenge.org/terms.

Interested in our summer programme?
You can kick-start your application by filling in some details online. Go to www.NCSTheChallenge.org, click ‘login’ and use your unique login details shown below to start your application:

Your NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Your young person password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

The website will tell you that your parent or guardian will need to fill in the main part of your application. Please ask your parent or guardian to do this. If you’re not sure who can complete your application form, please get in touch with us and we’ll have a chat (our contact details are at the end of this email).

Alternatively, if your parent or guardian would like a paper application form instead, they can call us on 0203 542 2400 and we’ll send one to them in the post.

Interested in our october 2016 half-term programme?
Applications for our October programmes don’t open till May, so please check out www.NCSTheChallenge.org at this time and follow the instructions above to kick-start your application.

Is there a cost?
Government backing means NCS costs you no more than a £50 admin fee - even though each place is valued at over £1000. Plus, you get an extra £5 discount if your application is filled in online! We would never want the cost to stop you taking part, so your parent or guardian can also ask for financial support when applying.

Any questions?
If you have any questions, take a look at questions.ncsthechallenge.org, or get in touch by emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org or calling 0203 542 2400. We’d be happy to hear from you.

Yours sincerely,

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services
The Challenge (largest provider of NCS)

*Our programme dates are within the half-term holidays of most schools in the areas we work in (plus some additional weekend days).
