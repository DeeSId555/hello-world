WHERE WILL YOU BE THIS SEPTEMBER?

You may be under a lot of pressure about what to do next, from your teachers, your parents and even your friends. It can be tough to decide what is best for you, whether it’s getting a place at university, finding a job or taking a meaningful gap year. Perhaps you just don’t know and you only have a short time to figure it out!

This is where we come in.

What is it?

Step Forward is a full-time 12-month school leavers programme that helps you launch your career and make decisions about your future. Get paid £9,000 to work at a high quality employer, develop skills to get ahead, gain a qualification and make new friends.

How do I apply?

We have a limited number of spaces left but there is still time to apply, and as a graduate of NCS with The Challenge we can fast track your application. The best way to apply is online.

- Deadline for applications is: 21st July 2014
- Assessment days: 25th and 26th July

For more information, please visit our website, or e-mail us at
step.forward@the-challenge.org.

We have quality employers lined up just waiting for you to come on board.  Don’t leave your future to chance.
