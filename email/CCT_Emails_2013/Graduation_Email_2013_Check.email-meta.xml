Hours to make up for graduation


Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on taking part in NCS powered by The Challenge this Autumn!

As you know, your Graduation is coming up soon. However, our records indicate that you have missed some of the programme. You therefore need to make up {!Contact.Hours_required_for_graduation__c} hours in order to be able to Graduate. To make up hours you need to:

Take part in a voluntary activity that involves spending time, unpaid, doing something that aims to benefit the environment or your community.
Register the hours you spend volunteering with us.


Examples of activities that can be used to make up hours:

Leading sessions at a local youth group or uniformed group such as guides or scouts.
Giving time to a local community member, group or charity, eg volunteering at a local charity shop, volunteering in the office of a local charity, acting as a marshal at a charity fun run, or mowing your neighbour’s lawn.
Running an after school sports club for younger pupils at your school.


Examples of activities that cannot be used to make up hours:

Giving time to a profit making organisation.
Paid work for a local charity or community group, eg being paid to distribute leaflets promoting a charity.
Helping relatives or friends, eg mowing your parents’ lawn, cooking your nan dinner.


To register your hours online go to The Challenge Society website (http://www.thechallengesociety.org) and login using the TCS Login card you were given during the programme. Click on “Log My Hours” to enter a record of your volunteering. You can also contact us using your team’s Facebook page to report the number of hours you have made up.

If you have any questions about the number of hours you need to make up or how to log them, please call our central team on 020 3542 2400 or email contact@the-challenge.org.

The deadline for making up hours is mid-day (1200) on the day before your Graduation. If you have not been able to make up the hours you need to Graduate, you are still invited to attend Graduation with the rest of your wave. However, you will not be eligible for a Graduation certificate.

Yours sincerely,
