Sorry we missed you...



Dear {!Contact.FirstName} and Parent or Guardian,

We recently tried to contact you about a fantastic opportunity with NCS (National Citizen Service) that {!Contact.FirstName} has expressed an interest in. We would like to introduce you to the benefits of the NCS programme and explain how {!Contact.FirstName} can get involved.

What is NCS?
NCS is an exciting, part-residential youth programme running during October half term* and over four weekend days in November. It&apos;s the perfect opportunity for 16-17 year olds to develop skills which will look great on a CV or UCAS application - and to make friends and have fun along the way!

Over 130,000 young people have already taken part in NCS.  To find out more information about the benefits of the programme visit our website: http://www.ncsthechallenge.org/

The Challenge is offering this once-in-a-lifetime experience in or near your area this autumn. The meeting points for NCS will generally be based in the area of the young person&apos;s school or a nearby area. There are three parts to the autumn programme:

Part 1 - Get Active (in October half term): Four days (three nights) staying away from home in the countryside doing outdoor adventure activities.
Part 2 - Get Involved (in October half term): Three activity days developing skills, staying at home at night.
Part 3 - Make Your Mark (weekend days on 7, 8, 14 and 21 November): Four weekend days designing and running a project in the local community, staying at home at night.

Programme start dates will vary from the Friday evening (23 October) through to the Monday (26 October). We will confirm exact dates when confirming your place. You can also see specific start dates when booking online.

Here&apos;s a taster of what NCS is all about... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3dJB-K8nBY&amp;feature=youtu.be

Is there a cost?
Government funding means that NCS costs you no more than a £50 admin fee, even though each place is valued at over £1000.  Plus, you get an extra £5 discount when you sign up online. This cost covers accommodation, food and transport when staying away from home during Part 1, as well as all activities and equipment throughout NCS.

How do I apply?
Go to www.NCSTheChallenge.org and use the following unique login details to apply:


NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Young person password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

This young person password is for the initial stages of the application, which either the parent or guardian or the young person can complete. However, parts of the application can only be done by the parent or guardian. When you go online, the website will guide parents or guardians to create their own unique password so they can access the parent or guardian account and complete the application.

Any questions?
If you have any questions, take a look at questions.ncsthechallenge.org, or get in touch by calling 020 3542 2400 or emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org .

Places are filling up fast for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity so make sure you don&apos;t miss out! We&apos;ll be in touch once we&apos;ve received your application.

Yours sincerely,


Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services - The Challenge
