Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

About nine months ago, your child boarded a coach full of young people, staff and luggage to set off on a summer adventure. Returning a mere three weeks later they were full of exciting stories, bags of confidence and 60 new friends! One parent wrote to us to say “I cannot believe the change in my daughter, neither can the rest of the family. I would recommend The Challenge to anyone and everyone.”

Last year, your son or daughter was able to take part on The Challenge for just £35, which included all mentoring, teaching, travel, accommodation and kit.

Many young people however still cannot afford this, and so we are reaching out to any parent willing to contribute towards a bursary so they too can experience a summer of a lifetime!

If The Challenge Network positively impacted the life of your child, please click here to provide a bursary for another less fortunate person to experience The Challenge this summer.

Yours sincerely,

Craig Morley
Chief Executive
