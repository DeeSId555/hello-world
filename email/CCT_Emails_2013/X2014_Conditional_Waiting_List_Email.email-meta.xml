An update on your application for
NCS


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for beginning your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in NCS. As the programme is extremely popular, {!Contact.FirstName} is currently on the waiting list. However, {!Contact.FirstName} still has a good chance of getting a place.

What happens now?
To complete {!Contact.FirstName}’s application, please provide:

{!Contact.CAL_Missing_Items_Criteria_Paragraph__c}
Providing the above now will speed up the process if a place becomes available. If you have forgotten your log in details, you can recover them here to access your account.

We will then call you if a place becomes available. Places can become available at any time, right up to the programme start date. You will be entitled to a refund if we are unable to offer you a place.

How can I increase the chances of getting a place? Parents/guardians can log in to your account online or contact us to see if there are other programmes available to you, giving you a greater chance of getting a place for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Alternatively, if you are willing to travel to a programme which is further away and may have places available, please contact us to discuss this.

We hope to be able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a space soon.

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter - Director at The Challenge
