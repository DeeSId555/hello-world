Help us spread the word about NCS!




Dear {!Contact.Name},

We hope your child had a once-in-a lifetime experience with us this summer on NCS.

This summer saw over 16,000 young people taking part – giving them the chance to find new friends and learn new skills whilst making their mark in their local communities. We’ve had a lot of extremely positive feedback from both parents and participants - just take a look at our Facebook reviews.

This autumn half-term, we are opening up the opportunity for year 12s (or young people of equivalent age) to experience an exciting condensed version of NCS with The Challenge. This will run from 25 to 31 October, with social action days in November.

If your child enjoyed and benefited from NCS why not spread the word and let other parents of year 12 pupils know about the autumn half-term programme. Like summer, the programme costs just £50 (with discounts and bursaries available) and all accommodation, transport and food included.




We want more young people to have the same experience as your child, so please help us by spreading the word about the half-term programme to other parents

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge
