For your action


Dear {!Contact.FirstName} and Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for beginning {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for a place on NCS with The Challenge.

Unfortunately we have not yet received all the information we need to confirm {!Contact.FirstName}’s place on the programme. Due to high demand for places on The Challenge we have temporarily placed {!Contact.FirstName} on a waiting list until we receive the information we require.

All we need in order to finish processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s place is:

{!Contact.CAL_Missing_Items_Criteria_Paragraph__c}
Call us: 0203 542 2400 / Email us: contact@the-challenge.org /
Log into our website at: www.the-challenge.org

Replace with website name

As places are filling up very rapidly across the country, we would urge {!Contact.FirstName} to remind friends to take part in this exciting and unique opportunity.

Yours sincerely,


Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge Network
