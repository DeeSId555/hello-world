Chances to take part in NCS



Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We understand that you may have been interested in National Citizen Service (NCS), but can’t take part this summer. We are The Challenge and we’re running NCS in your area in 2016, so we just wanted to let you know that there are other chances to take part in NCS!

Not sure if NCS is for you?

Here&apos;s a taster of what NCS is about...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a591P6wYiGU 


NCS is a life-changing experience. It’s an opportunity to try new activities, make new friends and build the skills and confidence to help you in your future. Over 130,000 young people have already taken part - don&apos;t miss your chance! For more details, check out  NCSTheChallenge.org.

When is NCS running in 2016?
In 2016, The Challenge will be running NCS on lots of different dates throughout the  summer holidays. But, if you’re busy all summer, we also have a programme running during October half-term*, with some weekend days after. So you should be able to find a programme that fits in with your plans.

You&apos;ll need to be the right age to take part - you can check our age eligibility requirements at www.NCSTheChallenge.org/terms.

What should I do if I decide to take part in the summer programme?
You can kick-start your application by filling in some details online. Go to  www.NCSTheChallenge.org, click ‘login’ and use your unique login details shown below to start your application:

Your NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Your young person password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}

The website will tell you that your parent or guardian will need to fill in the main part of your application. Please ask your parent or guardian to do this. If you’re not sure who can complete your application form, please get in touch with us and we’ll have a chat (our contact details are at the end of this email).

Alternatively, if your parent or guardian would like a paper application form instead, they can call us on 0203 542 2400 and we’ll send one to them in the post.

Even though you expressed a preference to take part at a certain time, all our dates are subject to availability - so please ask your parent or guardian to complete your application and select your dates as soon as possible!

And what if I’m interested in an October half-term programme?
Applications for our October programmes don’t open till May, so please check out  www.NCSTheChallenge.org at this time and follow the instructions above to kick-start your application.

What if I have more questions?
If you have any questions, or need more information about the programme to make up your mind, take a look at  questions.ncsthechallenge.org. Or, you can get in touch by emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org or calling 0203 542 2400.

We hope you get a chance to sign up for this life-changing opportunity.

Yours sincerely,

Tanya Dunne
Head of Customer Services
The Challenge (largest provider of NCS)



*Our programme dates are within the half-term holidays of most schools in the areas we work in (plus some additional weekend days).
