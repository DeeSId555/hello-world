    <subject>Information about your application for NCS powered by The Challenge</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} and Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for beginning {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for a place on NCS (National Citizen Service) powered by The Challenge.

Unfortunately we have not yet received the full information we need to confirm {!Contact.FirstName}’s place on the programme, and due to high demand for places on the programme we have temporarily placed {!Contact.FirstName} on a waiting list until we receive this.

All we need in order to finish processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s place is:

{!Contact.CAL_Missing_Items_Criteria_Paragraph__c}
Call us: 0203 542 2400 / Email us: contact@the-challenge.org /
Log into our website at: www.the-challenge.org

Once we have received the missing details, we will be able to continue processing the application and will contact you if we need any further information.

When the application is complete, we will confirm {!Contact.FirstName}’s place as soon as possible. In the unlikely situation that we are not able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place, and provided that they have not previously given up a place we have offered, we will issue you a full refund.

If you have any questions, please do get in touch with us so that we can assist you.


Yours sincerely,


Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge Network
