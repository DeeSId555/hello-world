https://c.na8.content.force.com/email/{!Wave__c.Programme_Pack_Letters__c}

You will need to arrange travel between home and the meeting points at the start and return times shown.

 More information about {!Contact.FirstName}’s specific programme can be found below.


There are a few things you need to do before the programme starts:

1. {!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_emergency_phone_paragraph__c}
In the event of an emergency on the programme, we will use this phone number to contact parents/guardians. It is your responsibility to ensure that we have a correct number, that someone will be available to take calls on it, and that all of the contact information you have provided is up-to-date. Please make sure you tell us about any changes.

2. Please call or e-mail us if there have been any changes to {!Contact.FirstName}’s medical, support or dietary information since you provided it, or if you need to provide any other details.
It is your responsibility to ensure we have full, correct and up-to-date medical, support and dietary information, including details of any medication*. If you have any questions about this, please call us.

3. Please read all the information in this pack carefully and contact us if you have any questions.

You can call us on 0203 542 2400 or e-mail us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org


Additional information about {!Contact.FirstName}’s specific programme:

{!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_Girls_Only_Wave__c}{!Contact.FirstName} will need to wear a helmet to participate in some activities. We recommend that participants who usually wear religious headwear (e.g. headscarves, turbans, etc.) bring some which can be worn under a helmet.

Packing list: Please read the packing list in your information booklet carefully. Make sure {!Contact.FirstName} is prepared for the cold weather as they will be spending time outdoors.

Accommodation: You will notice that the booklet says that accommodation varies. On {!Contact.FirstName}’s programme, the accommodation for the residential part of the programme (14-17 February) will be dormitory accommodation.

If a venue or time is shown on {!Contact.FirstName}’s timetable as &quot;TBC&quot; or “to be confirmed&quot;, or if there is an unavoidable venue change, we will provide new information as soon as the details are finalised.

If {!Contact.FirstName} can no longer attend, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can try to offer this once-in-a-lifetime place to another young person.

We are looking forward to welcoming {!Contact.FirstName} to NCS!

Yours sincerely,
