The Challenge Society!

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

We hope you are looking forward to a lovely summer and managed to get involved in all the amazing opportunities that were available with The Challenge Society this year.

We want to hear from you!

Your opinion on The Challenge Society is very important to us. Thank you if you have already taken part in a research survey with Launchpad – we appreciate your time.

Please see below a link to a different survey that we would love you to complete to help us to measure your involvement with us this year. It will only take you a couple of minutes to complete. If you have already completed this survey and sent it back to us via the post you do not need to complete it again.

We&apos;d also love to know more about your education and where you see yourself in the future. Part 2 of this survey is designed to find out more about the education and career plans of 16-18 year olds. By completing this survey you could win an Apple iPad Mini!

Thank you!

What happens now?

Now that it has been a year since you signed up to The Challenge summer programme we hope that you are well on your way to becoming a young leader. So we won’t be contacting you as frequently to let you know about what we are up to – we will leave things down to you to get involved in your own way.

You will still be able to find out about more opportunities to volunteer and continue to be involved throughout the year so make sure you keep an eye open for some interesting things happening near you by checking out the TCS website;

We look forward to seeing you this summer if you have signed up to be Associate Mentor. This will be an amazing opportunity to develop all those key skills like leadership and communication as well being a great thing to put on your CV! For more info please email associate.mentors@the-challenge.org

Make sure you keep an eye on our facebook page facebook.com/thechallengesociety and follow us on twitter @UK_TCS for all the latest opportunities and news.



Good luck and we hope to see you again soon.
