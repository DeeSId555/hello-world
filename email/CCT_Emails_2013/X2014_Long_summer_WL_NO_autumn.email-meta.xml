Improve your chances of getting a place on NCS 2014


Dear {!Contact.Name} and Parent/Guardian,

Thank you for remaining on the waiting list for NCS with The Challenge - NCS has been really popular this year. As you haven’t got a place so far this summer, please check you have selected all programme dates you are available for.

For a taster of what NCS is like, take a look at this video that Shannon posted about her experience of Part 1 of the programme*. You can also visit Facebook / Twitter to see what people doing the programme are saying!


If you make sure you have selected all the programmes you can attend, you will give yourself the best chance of being able to develop skills, make new friends and have fun with NCS in 2014. Simply:

1. Log back in to your online account here - parents/guardians will need to do this.
2. Go to the choose dates section and click show dates.
3. Click change your current date selection and select all the extra programme dates you are available for. Do not click on the dates you have selected previously, as this will remove you from those waiting lists.
4. Click continue.
We will let you know if you get a place.

Act now to give yourself the best chance of having this experience of a lifetime!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter - Director at The Challenge
