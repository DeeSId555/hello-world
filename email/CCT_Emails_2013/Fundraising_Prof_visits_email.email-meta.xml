    <subject>The Challenge Network: Provide a bursary for a young person.</subject>
    <textOnly>NCS Powered by The Challenge Network

Thank you for hosting your recent professional visit. We really appreciated your time in perfecting their campaigns before the team met the Dragons!

Can you believe that the team had only met each other 3 weeks previously? One parent wrote to us to say “I cannot believe the change in my daughter, neither can the rest of the family. I would recommend The Challenge to anyone and everyone.”

The Challenge summer programme is offered to all young people for as little as £35, inclusive of all mentoring, teaching, travel, accommodation and kit. Many young people however still cannot afford this one off payment, and so we are reaching out to any parent willing to contribute towards their bursary.

We are hoping to raise £20,000 towards the costs of bursaries that enable young people from all backgrounds to take advantage of NCS powered by The Challenge. Please click here to contribute towards a bursary for another less fortunate person to experience The Challenge Programme in future years.


Yours sincerely,


Craig Morley
Chief Executive
