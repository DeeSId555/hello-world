    <textOnly>NCS with The Challenge Network

Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

Now that the dust has settled, and with all graduations complete, I would like to congratulate the 14,000 young people who took part on The National Citizen Service with The Challenge this year. Their courage to take on something new, the friendships that were created and sustained, and the achievement in finishing what they set out to do, is testament to real strength of character of those who took part.

The bursary fund we set up last year provides the means for any young person, no matter their financial background, to experience NCS with The Challenge.

This appeal was sent out to all parents and guardians, and we raised a phenomenal £16,000 through generous donations. It feels appropriate to thank each and every one of you who donated to this cause, ensuring that everyone who wants to do NCS with The Challenge, has the financial assistance to do so. Thank you very much for digging deep, particularly in today&apos;s economic climate.

Our online appeal is still open - as we try to reach our target of £20,000. Therefore, if you did not have the opportunity to donate previously, and would like to so - please click here.

A sincere thank you to you all, and the very best wishes for the festive period.

Yours sincerely,

Craig Morley
Chief Executive
