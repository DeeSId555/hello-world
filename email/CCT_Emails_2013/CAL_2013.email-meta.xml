CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE


Dear {!Contact.FirstName} and the Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName},

All we need in order to finish processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s place is:

Log into our website at: www.the-challenge.org

Please provide the above within two weeks. Once we have received this, we will be able to continue processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s application.

If you have any questions, or think you will be unable to complete {!Contact.FirstName}’s application within two weeks, please do get in touch with us as soon as possible so that we can assist you.
