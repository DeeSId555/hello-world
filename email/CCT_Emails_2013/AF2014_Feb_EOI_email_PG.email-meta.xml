Say YES to NCS this February half term




Dear Parent or Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

{!Contact.FirstName} expressed an interest in NCS with The Challenge but didn&apos;t sign up to come along this autumn. If they’re still interested, there’s another chance as we are now running a programme this February half term.

For a taster of what NCS is like, take a look at this 30 second film:


The NCS with The Challenge February half term programme is an exciting, part-residential programme for 16-17 year olds*. It&apos;s the perfect opportunity for {!Contact.FirstName} to develop skills which will look great on their CV or UCAS application, to make friends and have fun along the way. It runs over February half-term (14-20 February) and four weekend days in February and March. The programme structure is:

Part 1 - residential (4 days, 3 nights): 14 - 17 February
Part 2 – non-residential (3 days): 18 - 20 February
Part 3 – non-residential weekend days (4 days, not all consecutive): Saturday 28 February, Sunday 1 March, Saturday 7 March, Saturday 14 March.

If {!Contact.FirstName} is still interested, don&apos;t let them miss out on this chance to take part in NCS with The Challenge. It&apos;s quick and easy to sign up online, and online applications receive a £5 discount. Just follow this link and select the programme starting on 14 February. You can use the login details given to {!Contact.FirstName}, or recover them here.

Each place is valued at over £1000 but government backing means the only cost you&apos;ll pay is a £50 administration fee. Accommodation, transport and equipment used during the programme is all covered. If you need some help with the cost you can request financial support when signing up.

More questions? Take a look at our Questions page, or get in touch at contact@the-challenge.org or on 0203 542 2400.

Make sure {!Contact.FirstName} doesn&apos;t miss out on the experience of a lifetime this February half-term!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge
