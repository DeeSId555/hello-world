Reminder from NCS: social action days in September


Dear {!Contact.Name},

Don&apos;t forget to attend your NCS social action days. Your team will meet on one of the weekend days throughout September - please check your timetable to see which days if you&apos;re not sure.

The day before each social action day, we will send you a text telling you the confirmed details of where you need to meet. Do look out for this as it will contain up-to-date information (some venues may have changed from those originally on your timetable).

Remember, if you don&apos;t attend all your social action days then you may not be able to graduate and receive your certificate, signed by the Prime Minister. You can find our absence policy here to see how much of NCS you need to attend to be able to graduate: http://www.ncsthechallenge.org/terms-and-conditions/

If you have any questions, please call us on 0203 542 2400.

We hope to see you at your social action day this weekend!

Yours sincerely,
Jo Lunt
Customer Services Manager
