Tomorrow&apos;s Graduation
is Cancelled


Dear {!Contact.Parent_Name__c},

It is with great regret that tomorrow&apos;s South Birmingham NCS graduation at the Birmingham Conservatoire has been cancelled. This is due to the planned march by the English Defence League (EDL) that will be taking place in close proximity to the venue. There are also counter demonstrations planned in Chamberlain Square which is directly outside the venue.

Following the disturbances last year at an EDL march in the City and advice from West Midlands Police we have taken the decision to postpone the graduation event. We will inform you once a new date had been decided.

Apologies for the inconvenience this has caused and we look forward to informing you once we have rescheduled the event.

Best wishes,

The Challenge
