DISCOVER YOUR PATH. SECURE YOUR FUTURE.

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

This time last year, you’d just completed The Challenge. Does it seem like it was just yesterday? Or ages ago? How are you feeling about next year?

Excited about finishing school or college but worried about what to do next? Are you under pressure to make decisions about your future from your teachers, from your parents and even from your friends? Does it feel like everyone thinks they know what’s right for you? It’s tough to work things out when everyone’s worried about getting a place at university or finding a job.

Why not give yourself the chance to discover your own path? We want to tell you about a great opportunity called Step Forward.

What is it?

Step Forward is a full-time 12-month programme that helps you launch your career and make decisions about your future. Get paid to work at a high quality employer, make new friends and develop skills to get ahead.

Who’s it for?

Worried about finding a job after university? Get experience before university to make you more employable when you graduate.

Want a meaningful Gap Year experience but worried about the cost? Learn new skills, meet new people right here in London and get paid £9,000.

Want to keep your options open, but don’t know how? Get your own mentor who is trained to help you discover your path.

Want the independence of working but unsure how to progress in your career? Fast track your career with the skills you need to thrive and the networks you need to get your first promotion.
