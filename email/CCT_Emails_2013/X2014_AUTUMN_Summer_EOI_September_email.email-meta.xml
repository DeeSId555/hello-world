    <textOnly>NCS POWERED BY THE CHALLENGE

Say YES to NCS this October half-term



Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We noticed you expressed an interest in NCS with The Challenge , but didn&apos;t sign up to come along this summer.  Don’t miss out on your last chance to sign up for NCS with The Challenge in 2014 - apply now!

For a taster of what NCS is like, take a look at this video that Shannon posted about her experience of Part 1 of the programme1. You can also visit Facebook / Twitter to see what people doing the programme are saying!

The NCS with The Challenge autumn programme is an exciting, part-residential  programme for 16-17 year olds*. It&apos;s the perfect opportunity to develop skills which look great on your CV or UCAS application – and to make friends and have fun along the way. It runs over October half-term (25-31 October) and four weekend days in November. The programme structure is:

Part 1 - residential (4 days, 3 nights): 25 – 28 October
Part 2 – non-residential (3 days): 29 – 31 October
Part 3 – non-residential weekend days (4 days, not all back-to-back): Saturday 8 November, Sunday 9 November, Saturday 15 November, Saturday 22 November.

The quickest and easiest way to sign up is online, where you will receive a £5 discount. Parents/guardians should follow this link to complete an application and select the programme starting on 25 October. You can use the login details you already have, or recover them here.

Each place is valued at over £1000 but government backing ensures that the full programme costs you no more than a £50 administration fee. This includes all accommodation, food, transport and equipment used during the programme. Financial support can also be requested when signing up if you need extra help with the cost. If you made a payment for the summer programme, you can use this for the October programme.

More questions? Take a look at our Questions page, or get in touch with us at contact@the-challenge.org or on 0203 542 2400.

Act now to sign up for this experience of a lifetime!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge
