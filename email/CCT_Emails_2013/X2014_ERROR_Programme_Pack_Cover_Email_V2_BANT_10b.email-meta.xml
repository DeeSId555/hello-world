Important: NCS timetable change


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We are writing to let you know that the locations on the timetable we sent you before were wrong. We have now changed these to show your programme&apos;s correct locations.

Please ignore the timetable you were sent before and see below for your correct timetable.

{!Contact.FirstName}’s new timetable can be found by clicking here. Please check this carefully as the details have changed. You will need to arrange travel between home and the meeting points at the start and return times shown.

If you have any questions about your new timetable, please call Jade Palmer on 07785618495. Alternatively, you can email her at jade.palmer@the-challenge.org.

We are really sorry for any confusion this has caused and are looking forward to welcoming {!Contact.FirstName} to NCS with The Challenge!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge
