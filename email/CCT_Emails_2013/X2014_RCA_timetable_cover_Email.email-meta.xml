Your timetable for the final part of NCS



Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

Please check this timetable to find the dates, meeting points and times for {!Contact.FirstName}’s team. You will need to arrange travel between home and the meeting points at the start and return times shown.

You will be sent an invitation nearer the time. Graduates will also be able to take part in The Challenge Society, which offers exciting events and opportunities to those who have completed NCS with The Challenge.
