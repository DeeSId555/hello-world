There are still opportunities to take part in NCS 2014


Dear {!Contact.Name},

We noticed that the programme dates you selected to take part in NCS with The Challenge have now gone by.

NCS has been really popular this year, but we wanted to tell you that we still have opportunities for you to sign up to other programme dates.

To get a taster of what NCS is like, take a look at this video that Shannon posted about her experience of Part 1 of the programme*. You can also visit Facebook / Twitter to see what people doing the programme are saying!


Don’t miss out on this last chance to learn new skills, make friends and have fun with NCS in 2014. Simply:

1. Log back in to your online account here - parents/guardians will need to do this.
2. Go to the choose dates section and click show dates.
3. Click Change your current date selection and select as many programmes as you are available for.
4. Click continue.

Sign up soon while places are still available for this experience of a lifetime!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter - Director at The Challenge
