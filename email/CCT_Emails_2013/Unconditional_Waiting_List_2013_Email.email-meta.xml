You have been placed on a waiting list

Dear {!Contact.FirstName} and Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for completing {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s application for a place on The Challenge.


Due to the popularity of the programme, {!Contact.FirstName} has temporarily been placed on a waiting list. However, we closely track all allocations across the country and will endeavour to give {!Contact.FirstName} a place on  {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s preferred dates as soon as possible.


We will be in touch with you as soon as there is any progress in {!Contact.FirstName}â€™s application. At this point in time we are not certain when a place will become available, but we are confident we will be able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place on the programme. In the unlikely situation that we are not able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place, and provided that they have not previously given up a place we have offered, we will of course issue you a full refund.


We are excited that {!Contact.FirstName} has decided to take up this fantastic opportunity, and we will do our very best to ensure we can confirm {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s place as soon as possible.


If you have any questions, please do get in touch. You can call us on 020 7921 4404, or email us at contact@the-challenge.org.
As places are filling up very rapidly across the country, we would urge {!Contact.FirstName} to remind friends to take part in this exciting and unique opportunity.

Yours sincerely,

Rebecca Carter
