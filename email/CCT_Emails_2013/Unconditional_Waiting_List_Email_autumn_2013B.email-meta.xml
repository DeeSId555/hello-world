    <subject>Update about your application for NCS with The Challenge.</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} and Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for completing {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for a place on NCS (National Citizen Service) powered by The Challenge.

Due to the popularity of the programme, {!Contact.FirstName} has been placed on a waiting list. However, we closely track all allocations across the country and will give {!Contact.FirstName} a place on a programme as soon as one becomes available.

We will be in touch with you as soon as there is any progress in {!Contact.FirstName}’s application. In the unlikely situation that we are not able to offer {!Contact.FirstName} a place, and provided that they have not given up a place we have previously offered, we will issue you with a full refund.

We are pleased that {!Contact.FirstName} has decided to take up this fantastic opportunity, and we will confirm {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s place as soon as possible.

If you have any questions, please do get in touch. You can call us on 020 3542 2400, or email us at contact@the-challenge.org.


Yours sincerely,

Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge Network
