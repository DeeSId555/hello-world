Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on completing the first weekend of the RCA. This Saturday or Sunday you&apos;ll be getting stuck in completing the &apos;100 Challenge Challenge&apos; around Bromley to raise money for your partner charities. You have all set ambitious targets so remember to share your MyDonate page on Facebook, tweet the link on Twitter, write it in a letter, shout it from your rooftop... Ask everyone you know to sponsor you!!

Please remember to bring your lunch and an oyster card on the day, don’t forget to dress for the weather and arrive at 09:30am. There will be a prize for the person who has raised the most amount of money so please bring all of your fundraising on the day.  Remember, your charities need the money you are raising to continue the great work they are doing in the community.

Thanks,

The Challenge
