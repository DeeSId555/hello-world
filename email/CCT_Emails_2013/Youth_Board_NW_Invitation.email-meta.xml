Your invitation to the North Manchester
NCS Graduate Reunion Event


Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Have you heard the good news? Because you are invited for the reunion event this Easter that takes place at Cringle Park, Crossley Road, Manchester, M19 2QP on the 27th April at 11:30 – 16:00.

The youth board is hosting a picnic/party for all the graduates from last summer’s programme. We would like to invite you to a day of activities for you to enjoy with your wave members that is guaranteed to get you on your feet. The day will include a bunch of snacks and drinks absolutely free! We’ll have games around 12:30 but most of the day is for you to catch up with your friends.

There will be large indoor spaces as well if you would like to have your food indoors and gazebos outside.

Here’s the location if you’re not sure how to get there:



So, what are you waiting for? You need to confirm you will be coming as soon as possible - just reply to this email.
