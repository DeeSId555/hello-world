Dear Parent/ Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in NCS with The Challenge. We need to discuss the medical and support information you submitted for them with you. We have tried to contact you but have been unable to reach you.

Places are in very high demand, so unless we hear from you within 5 days of this email, we will move {!Contact.FirstName} to the waiting list.

We can only progress with an application once we have received and reviewed all of the information required. Places are provisional, dependent on the information provided and availability.

Yours sincerely,
