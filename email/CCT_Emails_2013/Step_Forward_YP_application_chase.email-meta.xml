DISCOVER YOUR PATH. SECURE YOUR FUTURE.

A couple of months ago we sent you details of our school leavers’ programme, Step Forward.

Step Forward gives you the professional and people skills needed to succeed in your future career whether you plan to go to university, straight into the world of work or are still finding your path.

If selected onto Step Forward you will get paid to work at a high quality employer for the year, gaining valuable experience which will make you more employable in the future.

Not only is Step Forward free, but you will get paid £9,000 over the year.

It’s not too late to apply, but you’ll have to act quickly!

Places are limited and we have already received an unprecedented number of applications.  Submit your online application form by Wednesday 11th December at the latest so that you don’t miss out on being considered for our assessment event on 21st December!

Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter to be kept up to date with the latest information.

Best of luck with your application!
