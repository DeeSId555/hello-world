    <subject>Your last chance to take on The Challenge!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have some good news for you. If you missed out on taking on The Challenge last year, you have one last chance to do it this summer! The Challenge is now available to young people up to age seventeen so if you are still in that age bracket this summer then get involved.

To refresh your memory… The Challenge Network is the lead provider of NCS (National Citizen Service).  It is a part-residential programme designed exclusively for 15-17 year olds, which begins with three challenges over fourteen days during the summer holidays, followed by four weekend days in September. It&apos;s a mix of physical and team challenges and social action projects. Most importantly it is a fun way for you to spend your time, meet new friends, get ahead and have an experience that you will never forget.

So, if you are interested then log into our website as a new user and apply for a place.  Places are very limited and are allocated on a first-come first-served basis, so don’t miss out; this is the last chance for you and your friends to take advantage of this unique opportunity.

For more information, visit our website or get in touch with one of our team through:

Talk to us: 020 7921 4404                     Write to us: contact@the-challenge.org

We look forward to hearing from you.
