Next steps for your application


Dear Parent/ Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for starting your application for {!Contact.FirstName} to take part in NCS with The Challenge! You&apos;re almost there, but part(s) of your application are missing. We have reserved {!Contact.FirstName} a provisional place for one week only whilst you complete these missing parts. Demand for places is high, so  if your application is not fully complete by  {!Contact.Letter_email_date_reserved_place_lost__c}, we will give the place to another young person and {!Contact.FirstName} will be moved to the waiting list.

All we need to continue processing {!Contact.FirstName}&apos;s application is:

{!Contact.CAL_Missing_Items_Criteria_Paragraph__c}

If you have forgotten your log in details, you can recover them here to access your account.

If there is a reason that you will be unable to complete your application within one week, please contact us. If {!Contact.FirstName} can no longer take part, please let us know straight away so that we can give this space to another young person. You can email us at contact@the-challenge.org or call us on 0203 542 2400.

Remember, we can only confirm a place after we have received and reviewed your complete application. We will let you know in writing if you have a confirmed place. Thank you in advance for taking these steps to complete {!Contact.FirstName}’s application for this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter - Director at The Challenge
