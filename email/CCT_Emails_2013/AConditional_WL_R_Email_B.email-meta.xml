Information about your application for NCS powered by The Challenge


Dear {!Contact.FirstName} and Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.FirstName},

Our records show that we have not yet received the full information we need to confirm {!Contact.FirstName}’s place on NCS (National Citizen Service) powered by The Challenge this autumn. We had reserved a place for {!Contact.FirstName}, but due to high demand for places on the programme we have placed {!Contact.FirstName} on a waiting list until we receive the information we require.

All we need in order to finish processing {!Contact.FirstName}’s place is:

{!Contact.CAL_Missing_Items_Criteria_Paragraph__c}
Call us: 0203 542 2400 / Email us: contact@the-challenge.org /
Log into our website at: www.the-challenge.org

Once we have received the missing details, we will be able to continue processing the application and will contact you if we need any further information.

Once the application is complete, we will confirm {!Contact.FirstName}’s place as soon as possible, and in the event that {!Contact.FirstName} remains on a waiting list we will let you know as soon as a place becomes available.

If you have any questions, please do get in touch with us so that we can assist you.


Yours sincerely,


Rebecca Carter
