Important: The return time for NCS Part 1 has changed


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

We are writing to confirm that the return time for Part 1 of NCS has changed and is now estimated to be at 4:00pm on 18/07/2014.

Please be aware that, due to traffic, this is still only an estimated time. Please contact your child on the day to get a more accurate time for their arrival at the return point.

This message should have been advertised at the meeting point on the first day of NCS with The Challenge, but we are writing to confirm this.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this.

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter - Director at The Challenge
