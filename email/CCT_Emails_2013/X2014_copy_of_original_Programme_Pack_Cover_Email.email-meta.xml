What you need to
know and do before the start of
NCS with The Challenge


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope {!Contact.FirstName} is excited about starting NCS with The Challenge. This email is your information pack, in which you will find:

• {!Contact.FirstName}’s timetable, showing the meeting points, venues and times for the programme. This can be found by clicking here. You will need to arrange travel between home and the meeting points at the start and return times shown.

• An online information booklet containing essential information, such as a detailed packing list and frequently asked questions. This can be found by clicking here. More information about {!Contact.FirstName}’s specific programme can be found below.


There are a few things you need to do before the programme starts:

1. {!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_emergency_phone_paragraph__c}
In the event of an emergency on the programme, we will use this number to contact parents/guardians. It is your responsibility to ensure that we have a correct number, that someone will be available to take calls on it, and that all of the contact information you have provided is up-to-date. Please make sure you notify us of any changes.

2. Please call or e-mail us if there have been any changes to {!Contact.FirstName}’s medical, support or dietary information since you provided it, or if you need to provide any other details.
It is your responsibility to ensure we have full, correct and up-to-date medical, support and dietary information, including details of any medication*. If you have any questions about this, please call us.

3. Please read all the information in this pack carefully and contact us if you have any questions.

You can call us on 0203 542 2400 or e-mail us at contact@the-challenge.org


Additional information about {!Contact.FirstName}’s specific programme:

{!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_Girls_Only_Wave__c}{!Contact.FirstName} will need to wear a helmet to participate in some activities. We recommend that participants who usually wear religious headwear (e.g. headscarves, turbans, etc.) bring some which can be worn under a helmet.

{!Wave_Selection__c.CAS_10c_kit_sentence__c} Accommodation: You will notice that the booklet says that accommodation varies. On {!Contact.FirstName}’s programme, the accommodation will be as follows -

Part 1: {!Wave_Selection__c.Part_1_accommodation_type__c}. Please note that in this part young people will usually go on a hike which involves camping overnight (we provide the kit for this).
Part 2: {!Wave_Selection__c.Part_2_accommodation_type__c}. All our accommodation comes with the necessary amenities, such as access to power sockets, showers, etc.

If a venue is shown on {!Contact.FirstName}’s timetable as “to be confirmed”, or if there is an unavoidable venue change, new information will be provided as soon as the details are finalised.

If {!Contact.FirstName} can no longer attend, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can try to offer this once-in-a-lifetime place to another young person.

We are looking forward to welcoming {!Contact.FirstName} to NCS with The Challenge!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge
