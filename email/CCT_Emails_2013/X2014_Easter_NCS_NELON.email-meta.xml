NCS 2014, the start of something amazing

Since January, we’ve been busy visiting schools all over London to let everyone know about NCS with The Challenge - and the awesome summer you could have after exams.

We’ve already had over 15,000 young people sign up nationwide, so don’t miss out on the summer of a lifetime.

Sign up here between 14 and 21 April and pay only £35. Quote the code NCSAPRIL3 on the website.

It All Starts At Yes

We visited the lucky 15,000th sign up, Milli Bray from Glenburn Sports College in Skelmersdale, to present her with a sweet treat and say thanks – take a look here

Sign up!

We really do only have a few places left, so don’t forget to apply during the Easter break – remember to quote your code!

Financial support is available so get in touch if you need assistance in paying.
