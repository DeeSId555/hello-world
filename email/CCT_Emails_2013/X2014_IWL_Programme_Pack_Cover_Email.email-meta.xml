What you need to
know and do before the start of
NCS


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for agreeing to come to the first day of our NCS programme on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c} in the hope that a place will become available. Please note that if a place becomes available for {!Contact.FirstName} before this, we will contact you.

As discussed with you, {!Contact.FirstName} is still on the waiting list.  However, each year there are people who are unable to attend at short notice, so we try our best to ensure that others are able to take up these valuable places on the programme.

We hope that a place might become available on the day for {!Contact.FirstName}, so look forward to seeing them there with their bags packed and ready to leave.  If a place does not become available, we will compensate you with a shopping voucher and you will be entitled to a refund.

If {!Contact.FirstName} is no longer able to turn up on {!Wave_Selection__c.PC_KO_Day__c}, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can try to offer this opportunity to another young person.

In case a place does become available, please read all the information in this email pack carefully and contact us on 0203 542 2400 or at contact@ncsthechallenge.org if you have any questions.



Your next steps

This is your information pack so you can be prepared for if a place comes up. Here you will find:

• {!Contact.FirstName}’s timetable, showing the meeting points, venues and times for the programme. This can be found by clicking here. If {!Contact.FirstName} gets a place, you will need to arrange travel between home and all the meeting points at the start and return times shown.

• An online information booklet containing essential information such as a detailed packing list and frequently asked questions. This can be found by clicking here. More information about the programme {!Contact.FirstName} is hoping to get a place on can be found below.

There are a few things you need to do before the programme starts:

1. {!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_emergency_phone_paragraph__c}
If {!Contact.FirstName} gets a place, in the event of an emergency on the programme we will use this number to contact parents/guardians. It is your responsibility to ensure that we have a correct number, that someone will be available to take calls on it, and that all of the contact information you have provided is up-to-date. Please make sure you notify us of any changes.

2. Please call or e-mail us if there have been any changes to {!Contact.FirstName}’s medical, support or dietary information since you provided it, or if you need to provide any other details.
It is your responsibility to ensure we have full, correct and up-to-date medical, support and dietary information, including details of any medication*. If you have any questions about this, please call us.

3. Please read all the information in this pack carefully and contact us if you have any questions.

You can call us on 0203 542 2400 or e-mail us at contact@ncsthechallenge.org


Additional information about the programme {!Contact.FirstName} is hoping to get a place on:

{!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_Pack_Girls_Only_Wave__c} Young people will need to wear a helmet to participate in some activities. We recommend that participants who usually wear religious headwear (e.g. headscarves, turbans, etc.) bring some which can be worn under a helmet.

Packing list: Please read the packing list in your information booklet carefully. Make sure {!Contact.FirstName} is prepared for the cold weather as they will be spending time outdoors.

{!Wave_Selection__c.CAS_10c_kit_sentence__c} Accomodation: You will notice that the booklet says that accommodation varies. On {!Contact.FirstName}’s programme, {!Wave_Selection__c.Programme_pack_accommodation_paragraph__c}

If a venue or time is shown on {!Contact.FirstName}’s timetable as &quot;TBC&quot; or “to be confirmed”, or if there is an unavoidable venue change, we will provide new information as soon as the details are finalised.


Yours sincerely,
