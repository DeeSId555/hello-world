Don&apos;t miss out on NCS



Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As you told us you&apos;re interested in National Citizen Service (NCS), we wanted to introduce ourselves. We are The Challenge and we’ll be running NCS in your area this summer. We’ve tried to contact you to tell you more about NCS but haven&apos;t managed to speak to you yet. So, here&apos;s a taster of what NCS is about...

NCS is a life-changing experience. It’s an opportunity to try new activities, make new friends and build the skills and confidence to help you in your future. Over 130,000 young people have already taken part - don&apos;t miss your chance! For more details, check out  NCSTheChallenge.org.

What do you do on NCS?

Activities vary from programme to programme, but here’s an overview of some of the activities on the NCS summer programme:

Part 1 – Get Active: Five days (four nights) staying away from home in the countryside doing outdoor adventure activities like canoeing, hiking, and rock climbing with your new teammates.

Part 2 - Get Involved: Five days (four nights) living independently away from home developing skills in either drama, enterprise, media, music, photography, art or sport. You will also work with organisations or local businesses to better understand the community around you.

Part 3- Make Your Mark: Community activity days (staying at home at night) where you and your team create your own project to benefit the local area and pitch your ideas to a panel of judges to win funding for it. You then use this funding to make your ideas come to life by carrying out your team project in the local community. And that&apos;s not all - you&apos;ll also get to carry out a project which will help a local charity, and fundraise to make it happen.

Is there a cost?
Government backing means NCS costs you no more than a £50 admin fee - even though each place is valued at over £1000. Plus, you get an extra £5 discount if your application is filled in online! We would never want the cost to stop you taking part, so your parent or guardian can also ask for financial support when applying.

How do I get signed up?
You can kick-start your application by filling in some details online. Go to www.NCSTheChallenge.org, click ‘login’ and use your unique login details shown below to start your application:

Your NCS ID: {!Contact.NCS_ID__c}
Your young person password: {!Contact.Login_PIN__c}


The website will tell you that your parent or guardian will need to fill in the main part of your application. Please ask your parent or guardian to do this. If you’re not sure who can complete your application form, please get in touch with us and we’ll have a chat (our contact details are at the end of this email).

Alternatively, if your parent or guardian would like a paper application form instead, they can call us on 0203 542 2400 and we’ll send one to them in the post.

Any questions?
If you have any questions, or need more information about the programme to make up your mind, take a look at questions.ncsthechallenge.org. Or, you can get in touch by emailing contact@ncsthechallenge.org or calling 0203 542 2400.

Places fill up fast so make sure you don&apos;t miss out!

Yours sincerely,

Tanya Dunne
