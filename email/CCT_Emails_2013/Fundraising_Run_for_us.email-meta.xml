    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We are delighted to announce that we have secured a total of 80 places in two different London races as a way to raise funds for our year-round programme, The Challenge Society. So whether you are a seasoned runner or complete novice up for a challenge, there is something for everyone!.

The two races are:

British 10K London run - taking place in Hyde Park on Sunday 14th July. The registration fee is £15 and the fundraising target for each competitor is £150.

Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon - taking place in Hyde Park on Sunday 6th October. The registration fee is £25 and the fundraising target for each competitor is £500.

All money raised will contribute towards facilitating personal development opportunities and help fund community projects for our young people.

If you, your friends or family members would like to take part in these events, please email our Fundraising Manager, Ruth Galea (ruth.galea@the-challenge.org) or contact her on 07908 946 228. You can take part in each event as an individual or as part of a group.

Places are filling up quickly so we hope to hear from you soon!

Yours sincerely,


Ruth Galea
