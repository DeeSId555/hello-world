Take on NCS with The Challenge this autumn


Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name} and {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope {!Contact.Name} is looking forward to starting NCS with The Challenge this autumn.

You are both warmly invited to a short information evening about NCS with The Challenge, where you can meet fellow parents and participants, and ask us any questions. Please also use this evening as an opportunity to bring any outstanding medical forms or payments.

The information evening will take place on {!Wave_Selection__c.Info_Eve_Date__c} at {!Wave_Selection__c.Info_Eve_time__c} at {!Wave_Selection__c.Info_Eve_venue_and_address__c}.  The evening will last approximately one hour, and there will be a short presentation beginning within 15 minutes of this start time. Please arrive promptly so that we are able to start on time.

Please confirm your attendance by emailing {!Wave_Selection__c.Info_Eve_SC_email_address__c} or by calling me on {!Wave_Selection__c.Info_Eve_Mktg_mobile_number__c}. You can also use this opportunity to ask any questions you may have regarding this evening or the programme in general.

We may also be holding an additional information evening on another day that week for people taking part from different areas, so if you cannot make this one, but would like to meet us, then please contact us for details.

This event is for parents/guardians and the participant, however if you would like to bring along somebody else you think might be interested in the programme, we would be happy to welcome them and discuss finding them a place. Please let us know when you confirm your attendance.

We are very excited about {!Contact.Name} starting NCS with The Challenge and hope to see you at the information evening.

Yours sincerely,

{!Wave_Selection__c.Info_Eve_Mktg_lead_name__c}
