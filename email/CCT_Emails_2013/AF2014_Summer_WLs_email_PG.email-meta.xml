Say YES to NCS this October half-term




Dear Parent/Guardian of {!Contact.Name},

{!Contact.FirstName} was on the waiting list for NCS with The Challenge. We are sorry we couldn&apos;t offer tham a place this summer, but we wanted to let you know that applications for our autumn half-term programme are open.

For a taster of what NCS is like, take a look at this 30 second film:


The NCS with The Challenge autumn programme is an exciting, part-residential programme for 16-17 year olds*. It&apos;s the perfect opportunity for {!Contact.FirstName} to develop skills which will look great on their CV or UCAS application, to make friends and have fun along the way. It runs over October half-term (25-31 October) and four weekend days in November. The programme structure is:

Part 1 - residential (4 days, 3 nights): 25 – 28 October
Part 2 – non-residential (3 days): 29 – 31 October
Part 3 – non-residential weekend days (4 days, not all consecutive): Saturday 8 November, Sunday 9 November, Saturday 15 November, Saturday 22 November.

If {!Contact.FirstName} is still interested, don&apos;t let them miss out on this chance to take part in NCS with The Challenge. It&apos;s quick and easy to sign up online, and online applications receive a £5 discount. Just follow this link and select the programme starting on 25 October. You can use the login details given to {!Contact.FirstName}, or recover them here.

Each place is valued at over £1000 but government backing means the only cost you&apos;ll pay is a £50 administration fee. Accommodation, food, transport and equipment used during the programme is all covered. If you need some help with this cost you can request financial support when signing up.

More questions? Take a look at our Questions page, or get in touch at contact@the-challenge.org or on 0203 542 2400.

Make sure {!Contact.FirstName} doesn&apos;t miss out on the experience of a lifetime this half-term!

Yours sincerely,



Rebecca Carter
Director at The Challenge
